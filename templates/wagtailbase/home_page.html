            <h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> What's DPRR?</h3>
            <p>The remarkable transformation of the Roman Republic (c. 509 to 31 BCE) from city-state to imperial power was led by a competitive aristocratic elite. The aim of the Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic (DPRR) is to facilitate our understanding of the structure and dynamics of this elite through prosopographical study. The DPRR is being developed as a collaborative project, funded by the AHRC, between the Departments of Classics and Digital Humanities at King's College London. The first step, which is nearly complete, is to create a digital database of the attested members of the Roman Republican elite by combining in a user-friendly format the data, or assertions, harvested mainly from Broughton's Magistrates of the Roman Republic (1951-86), Ruepke's Fasti Sacerdotum (2005) and Zmeskal's Adfinitas (2009). Already some editorial reconciliation of discrepancies and updating to reflect new evidence or arguments is taking place, but this will be an ongoing process to which all colleagues will be invited to contribute. The elite is broadly defined to include magistrates and senators, members of the groups conventionally termed the equites, and the known women of elite families. Search facilities are being developed to assist investigations into topics such as office-holding patterns, changing membership of the senate and the composition of families.</p>
