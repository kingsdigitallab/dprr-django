The variations in the traditions regarding Pompey?s age when he celebrated his first triumph leave the year in dispute. March 12, 79 is the latest possible date, but the text in Criniti?s edition of Gran. Lic. 36.1-3, Pompeius annos natus XXV . . . pro praetore in Africa triu[mph]avit IIII Idus. Martias, is strongly in favor of an earlier date, as Pompey was still 25 years of age on March 12, 80. And the order of the triumphs is also in favor of a date before 79. Badian (Hermes 83, 1955, 107-118** 89, 1961, 254-256) demolished the case for 79, and has presented a strong case for a date in 80, or perhaps in 81. The interval of time after his departure from Italy in 82 needed for his campaigns in Sicily and in Africa, and for his negotiations about a triumph, seems very short, even with the help of an intercalation, for a triumph on March 12, 81. Yet he did move speedily, and 80 is not without difficulties since in both 80 and 81 the significance of the attitude of Servilius, who became consul in 79, is not apparent. Moreover, it is difficult to attribute the fragment from Sallust?s Histories (2.22M) to Pompey?s father, for the phrase in Gellius (10.20.10), De Cn. Pompei reditu, would more naturally refer to Pompey himself. See Gellius 15.4 for the usual form of reference to Pompey?s father. On balance, the evidence appears to favor a date in 80** but see A. Keaveney, AC 41, 1981, 111-139. See above, on L. Cornelius Sulla Felix (392) regarding the date of his abdication of the dictatorship. In MRR 2.77, refer also to ILLRP 380. On Pompey?s conduct in 80 and 77, see R. E. Smith, Phoenix 14, 1960, 1-13. Propraetor (or Legatus?) in 77. The nature of Pompey?s command against Lepidus in 77 remains somewhat uncertain. He is not named in the text of Philippus? motion for an SCU (Sall. Hist. 1.77.22M) and was probably at that time not among those quibus imperium est. Twyman?s view that he  was perhaps appointed by the interrex, Ap. Claudius Pulcher, with imperium pro praetore is attractive, since he acted, as he had under Sulla, with considerable independence against Brutus and Scipio (Lepidus? son) in Cisalpine Gaul (MRR 2.90), but Plutarch?s statement is not specific (Pomp. 16.2** 17.1-4** cf. Twyman, ANRW 1.1, 1972, 842-844), and Catulus? order to disband the army, which Pompey continued to keep after the end of hostilities, suggests that he may have had authority over Pompey as his legatus pro praetore (cf. Criniti: ?come pro praetore sotto Catulo,? Mem. Ist. Lombard. 30, 1969, fasc. 4, 433). But he may simply have acted as senior colleague. Proconsul in Spain, 77-71. The dates of Pompey?s arrival in Spain and of events in the Sertorian War remain in dispute. Maurenbrecher, T. Rice Holmes, Gelzer, and Gabba, and MRR, have him winter in Gaul and enter Spain in the spring of 76** another group, Bienkowski, Stahl, Schulten (whose construction of events is largely followed in MRR), and Spann, believe that he crossed the Pyrenees and wintered in Catalonia, while Crispo would place both his arrival in Spain and the battle of Lauro, with the death of his legate Laelius (5), all before the winter of 77/76 (NRS 36, 1952, 189-225), thus making it necessary to rearrange the events of the following years. Crispo is supported by Frassinetti (Studi Urbinati 49.1, 1975, 381-398), and accepted by  Konrad (Sertorius 53-60). In favor of this view it can be urged that Pompey?s letter to the Senate (late in 75,  Sall. Hist. 2.98M) makes no mention of his winter quarters in Gaul and admits no interruption in activities from the raising of his army to his settlement in winter quarters (inter saevissimos hostes) after his first battle with Sertorius, and Obsequens (58) records the death of Laelius at Lauro under the consuls of 77. This dating, moreover, is the one most consistent with the actions and situation presented in the fragments preserved of Livy 91 (fr. 22W), if it is properly dated to 77/76 (Frassinetti, 381-393** Konrad, 53-75). These describe the siege and capture of Contrebia by Sertorius, his winter camp at Castra Aelia, his arrangements in the spring, presumably of 76, for Perperna to protect the coastal regions against Pompey, and for Hirtuleius, previously at the Lauro (Sall. Hist. 31M), to guard against Metellus in the ?other province,? while Sertorius reduced various Celtiberian and northern tribes, won the Ebro valley, and recruited troops and supplies through M. Marius his quaestor and C. Insteius his prefect of horse. The chief consideration against this reconstruction is the question whether there  was sufficient time after the defeat and death of Lepidus in the spring or early summer of 77 (Criniti, 445) for Perperna to transfer his quite considerable forces from Sardinia by sea to Spain, and for Pompey, although he already had substantial forces under his command, some probably in Cisalpine Gaul, to win his Spanish proconsulate from the Senate, make his preparations, and carry through against some Gallic opposition the long march to Spain and down to Lauro, about halfway down the east coast. The very considerable problem of time and of the passage of troops and supplies might be met if a start could be made early in the summer, and there were no delays, of which Pompey gives no hint in his letter, or if it was not yet the union of Perperna?s troops with Sertorius after the death of Lepidus that made the need for Pompey?s command seem urgent to the Senate. The apparent implication of our sources that events from the defeat of Lepidus to Pompey?s defeat at the battle  of Lauro may all be placed within 77 may be accepted as possible, if not certain. What of the resulting rearrangement of the events of 76 and 75? To early in 76, therefore, would be attributed Sertorius? operations from Castra Aelia intended to secure control of the vital areas of Celtiberia, the northern tribes and the Ebro valley, while Perperna and Herennius were to keep watch on Pompey and the east coast, and Hirtuleius to obstruct Metellus in the south. After Metellus? defeat of Hirtuleius in the heat of summer (see MRR 2.98, and Frontin. Str. 2.1.2) with the annihilation of his army, Sertorius moved from Segontia, apparently to join Perperna and Herennius in an attack on Pompey before Metellus could join him. Pompey moved first and won an engagement near Valentia (the battle of the Turia), killing Herennius and,capturing Valentia (Plut. Pomp. 18.3** cf. Sall. Hist. 2.53-55M). Sertorius, joining Perperna, came up and attacked Pompey near the Sucro, driving him back on his left wing while Perperna on the right was driven back by Pompey?s legate Afranius (Plut. Pomp. 19** Sert. 18** Cic. Balb. 5** Frontin. Str. 2.13.3). Renewal of a pitched battle was prevented by the arrival of Metellus, and Sertorius retreated to the highlands, followed by both Pompey and Metellus. If the reading in App. BC  1.110, #, is correct (see Gabba, ed. P. 3105** cf. Plut. Sert. 21.2: #) the next big engagment was forced upon Sertorius near modern SigÅenza, and despite some successes on either side, Sertorius? defeat of Pompey, and the death of Pompey?s proquaestor Memmius, and Metellus? defeat of Perperna, it ended in a clear win for Pompey and Metellus. Sertorius retreated to winter quarters in Clunia (Plut. Sert. 21.1-3** App. BC 1.110** Sall. Hist 2.66- 68M** Liv. Per. 92). Here under siege (winter 76/75?) he broke out to join new forces and cut off supplies from Pompey and Metellus until Pompey went to winter among the Vaccaei (Vascones?) and Metellus went to Gaul (Sall. Hist. 2.98M** Plut. Sert. 19.4-6** Liv. Per. 92). This arrangement crowds many events into the years 77 and 76, and leaves a rather sparse record in our sources for the remaining years of the Sertorian War. Yet the situation at the end of 76 and the beginning of 75, the guerrilla war with the cutting off of supplies to the Roman forces, agrees with that implied in Cotta?s speech (Sall. Hist. 2.47M, probably delivered early in 75). In this year Sertorius, who kept contact with the east coast at such points as Dianium, made his alliance with Mithridates and continued to have help from the pirates (Plut. Sert. 23-24** App. Mith. 68** Sall. Hist. 2.79M, and 90M** Liv. Per. 93). He made difficulties by avoiding battle with Pompey and Metellus and cutting communications, though weakened by dissension in his own camp (Plut. Sert. 25** App. BC 1.112). By early in 74, Pompey demanded men, supplies, and money from Rome (Sall. Hist. 2.79M). Both sides devastated the land (Sall. Hist. 2.98M**  Plut. Pomp. 19.6** Sert. 21.5-6). After Pompey failed to take Pallantia, and both he and Metellus Calagurris, they separated for the winter of 75/74** Metellus returned to Hisp. Ult., probably winning Bilbilis and Segobriga on the way (Strabo 3.4.13, 162C** Sall. Hist. 2.70M** Plut. Sert. 22), while Pompey was forced to go to Gaul, leaving his legate Titurius with fifteen cohorts in Celtiberia (Sall. Hist. 2.93-98M** Liv. Per. 93). In 74, Sertorius? increasing difficulties with both his Roman and his Iberian supporters, and his increasing severity, weakened his support and turned many against him (Liv. Per. 92** Plut. Sert. 25** App. BC 1.112, 113** Diod. 37.22a). Pompey, meantime, received his needed troops, money, and supplies (Sall. Hist. 2.98M). While M. Antonius (MRR 1.101-102) attacked the pirates on the Spanish coast (Sall. Hist. 3.4-6), Pompey steadily increased his holdings although many tribes continued loyal to Sertorius (Strabo 3.4.10, 161C** Florus 2.10.9** Iul. Exup. 3** Oros. 5.23.14). Sertorius? lack of success, defections from him, his own increasing severity, and rivalries among the Romans led to a conspiracy against him and to his assassination (see MRR 2.118, for sources). The date,  whether in 73 or 72, has remained in dispute. Livy (Per. 96) provides a major text: interfectus est octavo ducatus sui anno (supported by Eutropius 6.1.3** octavo demum anno), and, counting inclusively from his return from Africa in 80, is in favor of 73. Another passage, to the effect that Pompey, after capturing and putting Perperna  to death, recepit Hispanias decimo fere anno quam coeptum est bellum, suggests a space of two more years for the defeat and death of Perperna, the reduction of unsubdued communities, and the organization of the province before his own return (see MRR 2.118 and 124). Another piece of evidence, neglected until recently, strongly supports a date in 73. Appian, in his account of the siege of Cyzicus by Mithridates, reports that some of Mithridates? advisors gave him deceptive advice upon learning during the siege of the death of Sertorius (App. Mith. 72). If this report is true, the siege, which in MRR 2.106-108 I favored dating to the winter of 74/73, cannot be earlier than 73/72, and the death of Sertorius, regularly dated to 72, cannot be later than 73. See W. H. Bennett, ?The Death of Sertorius and the Coin,? Historia 10, 1961, 459-472** cf. G. Perl, Stud.  Zur Gesch. U. Philosoph. D. Altertums 290-330** and note also the criticisms of Crispo and Bennett by B. Scardigli, Athenaeum 49, 1971, 229-270. Whichever of the various annual arrangements seems best for the chief events of the war  with Sertorius, it seems very probable that the death of Sertorius should be dated to 73, and the rest of Pompey?s proconsulship devoted to completion of the war, the postwar organization of Spain, and the return in 71. On Pompey?s part during this period of his command against Sertorius in the organization and settlement of Gallia Transalpina as a province, see E. Ebel, Phoenix 29, 1975, 358373, who favors also the series of somewhat later dates. Pompey is termed imperator in an inscription of Philadelphia of Lydia (Aepig. 1957, no. 18), and im[p. iter.] in one from Tarraco (Aepig. No. 309?Hisp. Ant. Epig. 4-5, 1953-1954, no. 487). Consul 70. Pompey?s candidacy in 71 was illegal because of his age, but did not require a professio in the city, which is demanded only from 63 on (Cic. De Leg. Agr. 2.24), and he could attend the elections which were held in the Campus outside the pomerium without losing his right to a triumph (J. Linderski, Mel. Michalowski 523-526, and bibliography cited there). Note also from Auximum, IMP. Cos. TER, ILLRP 382, 52 B.C. Consul III, 52. Sole consul from V. Kal. Mart. Mense intercalario (Ascon. 360 until the election of Metellus Scipio, probably in August. Note the inscription first published in 1957, dated with the name of Pompey alone, PRID(IE) NON(AS) QUINCT(ILES) CN. POMPEIO COS. TERT.: B. Andreae, Arch. Anz. 72, 1957, 235, no. 19** Aepig. 1959, no. 146** Degrassi, ILLRP 2.786a** A. E. Gordon, Latin Epigraphy no. 20, pp. 95-96. Addendum. I was mistaken, as Keaveney points out, in assuming that Pompey had been sent to Sicily before the battle at the Colline Gate, as he was still in the region north of Rome just before it (App. BC 1.92** cf. Plut. Sull. 29.3** and see Gabba, ed. Of App. BC 1, p. 246). His imperium in Sicily (it was pro praetore) was conferred by the Senate (Cic. Leg. Man. 61** Liv. Per. 89** cf. Gran. Lic. 36.2, Criniti), and after the death of Carbo, when Sulla became dictator, his imperium pro praetore was extended to Africa by both Sulla and the Senate (Plut. Pomp. 11.1). See A. Keaveney, AC 51, 1982, 111-139, esp. 126-127, on Pompey?s first triumph. Note also an inscription of Tarraco, naming him with the title Imp. (probably iterum) and dating from his victory over Sertorius in Spain (Hisp. Ant. Epig. 4/5, 1953/54, no. 487-Aepig. 1957, no. 3096. Alfîldy, Die rîmische Inschriften von Tarraco no. 1).[161-164x]
"According to Dio (54.36.1) and[104x] Tacitus (Ann. 3.58.2) no one was appointed in the place of L. Cornelius Merula, who died in 87. Caesar, it is held, was nominated but not inaugurated (see L. R. Taylor, CPh 36, 1941, 121** MRR 2.52, on Vell. 2.43.1, and Suet. Iul. 1.2), but Sumner (Orators 137-138) sees implied in these passages a possible case for actual possession of the priesthood before its loss when Sulla annulled the acta of the Cinnan regime, and also an explanation of Caesar's refusal to divorce Cornelia at Sulla's command. See also M. Leone, Studi E. Manni 193-212. Leg., lieut. under M. Antonius Creticus, 73. See MRR 2.113, 115, note 6. Sumner holds that the legatus named in SIG? 748 from Gytheum was more probably the obscure Catilinarian C. Iulius (Sall. Cat. 21.1), especially as Caesar was not yet a senator (Orators 138). But note Q. Cicero's attempt to have Atticus with him as his legatus in Asia, and Schleussner, Legaten 215. See Gelzer, Caesar 2425. Tribunus militum, 72 or 71. Gelzer (Caesar 25-26) favored the earlier date, L. R. Taylor the later (CPh 36, 1941, 121, note 32). If his colleague, Popillius, (4, 5) is the tribune of the plebs of 68 (MRR 2.168) a date in 72 allows more time for him to become quaestor in the interval (Sumner, Orators 136), but Syme opts for 71 for Caesar (JRS 53, 1963, 57). Quaestor 69. If Caesar was born before 100, the date based on evidence regarding his age at his death, and, I believe, the best attested (see Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 131** cf., less conclusively, Sumner, Orators 134-138), he was of course eligible for the quaestorship before 69, but an earlier date seems unlikely if his military tribunate and the Lex Plotia are  correctly dated above. Cadoux accepts 102 as the year of birth and asks: ""Does ?ante tempus' make it certain he did not serve two or more governors instead of one, for some special reason? Must Vetus' governorship follow, and not precede, that of Pupius Piso? Must the levy in Cisalpine Gaul be in 68?"" I have no examples of  quaestors who continued longer than the interim between governors, although I know no reason why they might not have done so. The date of Antistius Vetus depends on that of Caesar's quaestorship, the date of Pupius on  that of his own triumph (see below, on M. Pupius Piso [10], Cos. 61). The most probable time for the levy in Cisalpine Gaul (Suet. Iul. 8) is 68, since Marcius Rex (Cos. 68) left for his province of Cilicia either before the end of the year or early in 67 (see MRR 2.148, on the capture of P. Clodius Pulcher by the pirates while serving under him). Caesar's return at the time of the levy and in time to support the Lex Gabinia, which was proposed early in 67, is strongly in favor of a date for his quaestorship in 69. Curator of the Appian Way. The date is uncertain, but if Plutarch followed a chronological order in his notes on Caesar's extravagances (Caes. 5.5), it was between his quaestorship and his aedileship (RS, CP** on the aid such public benefactions gave to advancement, see Cic. Att. 1.1.2). Praetor 62. Shackleton Bailey terms him praetor urbanus (CLA 1.299), a position made probable by reason of his actions and the celebration of the rites of the Bona Dea in his house. Consul I 59. If born in 100, Caesar attained the consulship two years before the minimum age prescribed by the Leges Annales. Deutsch suggested that he had been granted some unrecorded exemption between his quaestorship and his aedileship (TAPhA 45, 1914, 23ff.), and Helen R. White, noting how close to senators winners of the civica corona were placed both in honor and in line for lection into the senate (Liv. 23.23.6** Plin. NH 16.13), suggested that Caesar's exemption was due to his winning this crown in 80 (Suet. Iul. 2** Advancement in Rank under the Roman Republic as a Reward for the Soldier and the Procurator, Bryn Mawr Diss., 1950), while Badian holds that this exemption was a privilege granted to patricians, as they were debarred from the tribunate and the plebeian aedileship (Studies 140-156)** but too few patrician careers are known in detail to test the suggestion fully. On his election, refer also to Dio 37.54.3. Consul 11, 48. In MRR 2.272, note that L de Delos 1587 has been republished by Raubitschek, JRS 44, 1954, 65, no. B. Refer also to IGRP 4.305, Pergamum** 4.928, Chios** and Raubitschek, ibid. 66, no. F, Athens** and SEG 15.748 from Phocaea. Dictator II, 48-47. Refer to Raubitschek, ibid. 67f., no. N, which should perhaps be dated late in 48 when Caesar was still Consul II and already Dictator 11. Note also an inscription found in Rome near the Porta Latina and dated as follows: C. CAESARE DICT(ATORE) ITER(UM) | M. ANTONIO MAG(ISTRO) EQ(UITUM), that is, between October 48 and autumn 47 (Manzella, Epigraphica 34, 1972, 105-130, esp. 117-120 AEpig. 1972, 14). See also IGRP 4.304 and 1677 (Raubitschek, no. O, Pergamum)** IG 2?.3222 (Raubitschek, no. P) on this dictatorship. Consul III 46, Dictator III 46-45. Caesar's third consulship is noted without mention of the dictatorship in two inscriptions of Samos: SEG 1.382 (Raubitschek, no. R), and Raubitschek, no. Q. Furthermore, an inscription of Thespiae as supplemented by Raubitschek (no. S, emending Plassart, BCH 50, 1926, 439, no. 75), # ..:, supports the view that the third dictatorship began before his fourth consulship and at  an interval after the end of the second dictatorship. Whether Caesar assumed it soon after the battle of Thapsus, just as he assumed his second as soon as communications permitted after the battle of Pharsalus (MRR 2.284, note 1), or waited until he returned to Rome late in July, as Raubitschek suggests, it appears that his series was now counted from April 46. Raubitschek adds the important suggestion that after the reform of the calendar in the autumn of 46 the third dictatorship would end in February 45 (that is, that although the dictatorships had become annual they were formulated in months in the traditional way), and the fourth in February 44. If so, his change to the position of Dictator Perpetuo at that time (see MRR 2.317-318) was not an irregular and sudden change in the middle of a term but one for which he prepared, as the occurrence of the title Dictator Perpetuo Designatus (see MRR 2.318) would also suggest. This weakens considerably Alfîldi's argument in favor of a sudden decision late in February or early in March, made in view of the failure of his plan to become rex at the Lupercalia (Studien Åber Caesars Monarchie 4ff., 19ff.** see MRR 2.318). Alfîldi bases his arguments upon a restudy of the coinage of 44 and in particular interprets a symbol on a unique coin of M. Mettius (see below) as   a representation of the diadem which Caesar refused at the Lupercalia and dedicated to Jupiter. The inscription on the coin reads DICT. QUART., and this along with a study of its place in the series of coins of 44 leads him to place the assumption of the perpetual dictatorship at the end of February or the beginning of March. Identification of the symbol is a technical numismatic problem, since the straight ribbon of the supposed diadem may be the result of either chance damage or deliberate alteration (see C. Kraay, NC 14, 1954, 18-31** Crawford, RRC 1.487-499, no. 480, and esp. 488, note 1), but it may be noted that Cicero (Phil. 2.87) implies that Caesar was already Dictator Perpetuo at the time of the Lupercalia on February 15. On MRR 2.305, on Caesar's fourth dictatorship, refer also to IG 12.11.35, and suppl. 1939. In MRR 2.317, last line, before ""February"" insert the word ""before."" The question whether Caesar's dictatorships, after the first, should be described as ref gerendae causa or, like Sulla's dictatorship, as ref publicae constituendae, once presented as the latter by Mommsen (StR 2?.704-705) and rejected by M. A. Levi (Costituzione Romana 207-210), has been raised again by L. Gasperini (Seconda Miscell. Gr. e. Rom. 2, 1965, 379-397) in connection with the discovery of a broken inscription of Tarentum, which he restores as follows: C. IULIO C. [f. Cael | SARE, PAT[re patr(iae)] | IMPERATO[re, dict(atore)] | REI PUBLIC[ae con | Stlt]UENDAE. He attributes it to Caesar's final dictatorship in 44, as Caesar became pater patriae at the beginning of that year (Dio 44.4.4), and treats it as a dating formula. Against this stands the restoration by M. Sordi (Epigraphica 31, 1969, 79-83), C. IULIO C. [f. Cae] | SARE PAT[rono] | IMPERATO[re IIIvir(o)] | REI PUBLIC[ae con | Stit]UENDAE [...], who interprets it as honorific and attributes it to the future Augustus. The filiation C. f. for Iulius Caesar is avoided in Latin inscriptions but may be defended at Tarentum as it is frequent in Greek inscriptions (see A. E. Raubitschek, above, for examples). For Caesar's adopted son they are few and must be limited to the brief period between November 27, 43, and early in 42, when Caesar was deified and Octavian assumed the style Divi f. (Syme, Historia 7, 1958, 172-188-RP 1.360-377). Note also above, on Dictator II, in AEpig. 1972, no. 14, the use of the title Dictator as part of a dating formula. Moreover, in the restoration above, the position of the word patrono before the major titles seems quite strange. On the whole, Gasperini's interpretation seems to hold good, and may have some further support from a passage in Cic. Att. 13.31.3, dated May 28, 45: atque id ipsum quod isti aiunt illum scribere, se nisi constitutes rebus non iturum in Parthos, id ego suadebam in illa epistula, if the phrase constitutis rebus can be taken as a reference to the apparent purpose of Caesar's dictatorship. See also L. Gasperini, Epigraphica 33, 1971, 48-59** I. Bitto, ibid. 32, 1970, 172-180** M. Sordi, Aevum 50, 1976, 151-153** J. M. Reynolds, JRS 61, 1971, 140, and 66, 1976, 178. Augur 47. In MRR 2.293, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.478, no. 467, 46 B.C. Note also among the honors voted to Caesar in 44 the grant of tribunician sacrosanctity (Dio 44.5.3), and see R. A.

1n MRR 1.561, add a reference to Veil. 2.17.3. Tr. mil. 103. See MRR 1.564, 566, note 10. The tribe which Sulla induced to leave the Cimbri and the Teutoni may really have been the German Marsi (Plut. Sulla 4.1), who are found beyond the Lower Rhine in the early Empire (Strabo 7.1.3, 290C** Tac. Ann. 1.50). Like the Helvetian Tigorini (Caes. BG 1.12), they may have joined the Cimbri and the Teutoni in their wanderings. See A. Keaveney, CPh 76, 1981, 292-294, following Leopold's Commentary of 1795. Praetor, propraetor in Cilicia. See MRR 2.14, 16, note 2, 18, 19, note 5 (proconsul, Rufius Festus 15). Debate regarding the dates of these offices continues. Badian, rightly objecting to the blank interval in the early 90s while Sulla's military laurels were fresh, interpreted # in Plut. Sulla 5.1-2 to mean statim, and placed his first candidacy for the praetorship in 99? his successful one in 98, his tenure as pr. urbanus in 97, and his mission in Cilicia and Cappadocia in 96 (Athenaeum 37, 1959, 279-303, now Studies 157-178). These dates are consistent with Sulla's age (born in 138), and also, so Badian maintains, with the political situation in Asia Minor at the time. But the order of events in Liv. Per. 70 is in favor of dates in and after 96, and the word #, like mox, gives room for some interval of time. Sumner, seeking an explanation of why, after Sulla had failed the first time because, as he asserted, the people expected him to be aedile and put on elaborate games, he could so soon be successful without satisfying them, suggested that upon defeat he had immediately run for the aedileship (i.e., for that of 98) and after winning this unattested office went on in 96 to win his praetorship for 95 and his Cilician command in 94 (Athenaeum 56, 1978, 395-396). Note however the passage of Pliny (NH 8.53) in which he states that it was in his praetorship (in praetura) that Sulla was the first of all to exhibit a combat of one hundred maned lions. Moreover, Sherwin-White's analysis of political events in eastern Asia Minor, and of the rather uncertain evidence of the coinages of the Cappadocian kings (see Simonetta, NC 1961, 9ff.), points to the installation of Ariobarzanes as king in 97-96, his expulsion and recourse to Rome ca. 95, and his restoration by Sulla in 94 (MRR 2.18, for sources** Sherwin-White, CQ 21, 1977, 173- 183** JRS 67, 1977, 62-75, esp. 70-72). On Sulla's meeting with the Parthian envoys, see now A. Keaveney,  AJPh 102, 1981, 195-212, esp. 195-199. On the Cnidian copy of the Lex de Piratis, see M. Hassall, M. Crawford, and J. M. Reynolds, JRS 64, 1974, 195-219** E. Badian and Th. R. Martin, ZPE 35, 1979, 153-167.  On its implications for the government of Cilicia, see Sherwin-White, JRS 66, 1976, 1-13, esp. 6-8. Leg., lieut. 89, perhaps pro praetore. In MRR 2.36, refer also to CIL 1?.1639, 2709, 2509a-ILLRP 346-348** and on Sulla and the Hirpini, to Sulla's Memoirs, frag. 3P** Diod. 37.2.8. See A. Keaveney, CPh 76, 1981, 294-296. Proconsul in Greece and Asia, 87-83. Refer also to CIL 1?.2828-ILLRP 224 (Imp. ca. 85) from Sicyon. Dictator, 82-80. In MRR 2.75, line 4, refer also to Cic., Mil. 39, and a recent -inscription found at Larinum, honoring Sulla Dictator as patron (M. R. Torelli, Athenaeum 51, 1973, 336-354). The date when he abdicated his dictatorship remains in dispute. There are four possibilities, all of them to some degree confused in our sources, because he was consul in 80 and became a private citizen at the earliest at the end of 80 and might have remained dictator until the election in 79 of the consuls for 78 (see MRR 2.82, note 1). The possibilities are as follows: (1) he abdicated with his legislative program largely completed upon entrance into office as consul of 80** (2) he did so at some time during his consulship, or (3) at the end of his consulship** or (4) in 79 before or after the elections for 78. Badian believes that Appian (BC 1.103-104) confused the abdication with the scene of his return to private life, and notes that he is never termed consul and dictator together and that the constitutional task (he was Dictator r. p. c.) had been largely completed in 81. Badian therefore favors the beginning of his consulship in 80 (Historia 11, 1962, 230** Athenaeum 48, 1970, 8-14), and finds support in the implications of a clause in Cicero, Rosc. Amer. 139, posteaquam magistratus creavit legesque constituit, sua cuique procuratio auctoritasque est restituta, and in the statement in Plut. Sulla 6.5-6, quoted from the Memoirs, that his colleague, Metellus Pius, Cos. 80, was # in a partnership of office. But some military resistance continued and neither the reforms nor the colonization were wholly completed. Twyman, noting Appian's tendency to have magistrates take office immediately after election, opts for the middle of 80 after the elections for 79 (Athenaeum 54, 1976, 77-97, 271- 295). In any case a date after 80 seems quite improbable. Consul 11, 80. Named as consul in his letter to the Thasians (Dunant and Pouilloux, Etudes Thas. 5.2, no. 174** Sherk, RDGE no. 20, pp. 115-118). Augur or Pontifex? A lively dispute continues regarding Sulla's priesthood, not about his attainment of the augurate, a well-attested fact, but about the date, and the question what was the priesthood which he had held before leaving for Greece in 88, the return of which he demanded in his negotiations with the Senate in 84 (App. BC 1.79). His coinage in 84-83, before his return to Italy, presents the symbols of the augurate, the lituus and the jug, centrally featured between two trophies with the inscription Imper Iterum on the reverses of issues of aurei and denarii (Crawford, RRC 1.373, no. 359, on the coins** Plut. Sulla 19** Fort. Rom. 4** Pausanias 9.40.7, on the victories and trophies** see MRR 2.55), clearly associating, as Crawford remarks, these symbols with his person. For B. Frier they showed that Sulla became an augur before or by 88, a view strongly opposed by Badian and defended by Frier (Arethusa 1, 1968, 26-46** 2, 1969, 187-199, with Badian's reply, ibid. 199-200). If M. Aemilius Scaurus was indubitably an augur (see above, on Scaurus [140]), and therefore also his successor in 88, L. Cornelius Scipio Asiagenes (see above on RE no. 338), Sulla would obviously be debarred as it was illegal, certainly in 57 (Dio 39.17) and probably much earlier, for members of the same gens to be members of the college of augurs together. See above, on Aemilius Scaurus (140), on the question whether ILS 9338 is exclusively Fasti Augurum or may be a part of more general Fasti Sacerdotum. On the other hand, later evidence indicates that augurs could not be deprived of their priesthood by exile or captivity (Plin. Ep. 4.8.1** Plut. RQ 99). Does Sulla's demand for restoration mean that he had held some other priesthood, or that this highly protected augural tenure could not survive the declaration by the government of Cinna that Sulla was a public enemy (App. BC 1.73** Mith. 51)?  We have no information whether Scipio Asiagenes was formally deprived of his priesthood. He was proscribed (Oros. 5.21.3), escaped or retired to Massilia, and died soon afterwards (Cic. Sest. 7** Schol. Bob. 126St). The coinages of Sulla's son Faustus (Crawford, RRC 1.449, no. 426, 56 B.C.), and of his grandson, Q. Pompeius Rufus (RE no. 41** Crawford, RRC 1.456, no. 434, 54 B.C.) show that Sulla was at some time an augur (cf. Suet. Gramm. 12, Cornelius Epicadus . . . Sullae dictatoris libertus calatorque in sacerdotio augurali). On balance  there seems to be no firm conclusion regarding an augurate in 88, and Crawford interprets Sulla's emphasis on augural symbols to be primarily an assertion of the validity of the imperium his opponents had withdrawn. What then was the priesthood he demanded to be restored? Badian suggests the pontificate and that Sulla was one of the very few during the Republic who held both major priesthoods. Cf A. Keaveney, AJAR 7, 150ff.[73-75]
See MRR 1.526, 527, note 1** Sumner, Orators 69-70. In Auct. Vir. Ill. 72.4 Scaurus is incorrectly described as praetor when on missions to Jugurtha, since Micipsa's death did not occur until 118 (Liv. Per. 62** Gsell, Hist. anc. de l?Afrique du Nord 7, 22), and Scaurus' missions are dated to 112 and 111 (MRR 1.539, 541** cf. Sall. Jug. 15). Asconius (19C) on Cicero Pro Scauro remarks that the prosecutors hastened the trial of his son for extortion for fear that he might purchase success in the imminent consular elections (in 54) and, like his father, enter upon office before judgment could be  rendered. This is usually taken to be the one brought by M. Iunius Brutus and usually dated to 114, the year after Scaurus' consulship (see Cic. Font. 38** Clu. 141** Brut. 130** Off. 2.50), but B. A. Marshall has suggested that it followed his praetorship or an immediately subsequent command (AJPh 98, 1977, 417-419). See Bloch, Mel. hist. anc. 25, 1909, 26-27** Malcovati, ORF? 165-166** and Gruen, RPCC 125, who all accept 114. Special Commission under the Lex Mamilia, 109. See MRR 1.547. Sumner, noting that in Sallust's record (Jug. 40.4) Scaurus strangely appears as an elected member of the commission, a former legatus of Calpurnius Bestia (MRR 1.541), and an advocatus of Bestia before it, and also perhaps censor still (MRR 1.545** elected 109** the exact date of his colleague's death is not known), conjectures that Sallust has confused Scaurus as quaesitor with a contemporary, M. Aurelius Scaurus, who gives some evidence of popular sympathies, and in 108 upon the condemnation of a certain Hortensius (Fast Cap.** MRR 2.548, probably father of the orator) succeeded him as consul suffectus (Phoenix 30, 1976, 73-75). See also G. Bloch, op. cit. 64-69** P. Fraccaro, Opuscula 2, 129, note 10, for other possibilities. Legatus in Asia before 93? See MRR 2.16, note 6, on the difficulty of defining the date, the reasons, and the purposes of Scaurus' legatio Asiatica (Ascon. 21C), especially in view of his physical infirmities, the difficulty in finding a basis for the charge of pecuniae captae brought by Servilius Caepio, and the cause of legationis Asiaticae invidia (Ascon.), and also the basis for the charge brought by Varius under his law in 90 of accepting bribes from Mithridates (Val. Max. 3.7.8** MRR 2.27). Bloch placed his mission ca. 104 (op. cit. 30-33), Badian and Luce after the return of Marius in 97 (Studies 172** and Historia 19, 1970, 169, resp.). Gruen (Historia 15, 1966, 56) and Gabba (ANR W 1.1.784) find its purpose obscure, and M. Sordi finds corruption of Scaurus by Mithridates incredible (RIL 107, 1973, 377). M. C. Alexander ingeniously avoids these difficulties by taking the legatio Asiatica to refer to the position of Rutilius Rufus under Mucius Scaevola in Asia and notes Cicero's reference to the climate of fear and ill-will that prevailed after his condemnation in 92 in a fragment of the Pro Scauro in Asconius (21C, P. Rutilio damnato nemo tam innocens videretur ut non timeret ilia). Scaurus may not have gone to Asia at all, but the climate of feeling in 92 emboldened Caepio to prosecute him at that time (TAPhA 111, 1981, 1-9). Although Asconius' phrase seems closely associated with the name of Scaurus, it is an attractive solution. Augur or Pontifex? 123-89 or 88. See MRR 1.515, 561, 562, note 7** 2.44. The discussion whether Scaurus was an augur (Ascon. 21C) or a pontifex (Suet. Nero 2.1** see R. Geer, CPh 24, 1929, 292-294) goes merrily on. Ordinarily, Asconius appears to be a more reliable source than Suetonius, but errors of fact and confusion of persons occur in him too (see the list presented by W. C. McDermott, Hermes 97, 1969, 242 and note 2). Discussion has proceeded from the assumption that both Asconius and Suetonius refer to the same action by Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (21), the future consul of 96: was he angered at Scaurus for preventing him from being coopted into the college of augurs (Asconius) or because he was not coopted as a pontifex (Suetonius)? But Scaurus is not mentioned in the passage in Suetonius, which contains the added information that the deceased father of Domitius had been a pontifex and he was angered that the college had coopted another than himself as successor. It is therefore probable that Scaurus is named here only as augur, and that, as proposed by Sumner (Orators 97-100), Domitius failed to be coopted into both colleges in turn before he became tribune of the plebs and carried his law making cooptation into the major priesthoods subject to the popular vote of seventeen tribes (see MRR 1.559** and below on Cn. Domitius (21], Cos. 96), and was himself elected both pontifex and pontifex maximus. The close relationship in form and lettering between the fragments of the Fasti Sacerdotum (ILS 9338) are taken to show that all belong to decuriae of augurs, but surely all the. priesthoods thus presented at one time would have the same formal appearances. If the known fragments belonged with certainty to lists of augurs, there  could, of course, be no doubt of Scaurus' augurate, but in fragment 1, C. Marcius Rutilus may be either an augur or a pontifex (Liv. 10.9.2)** so, too, Postumius Albus (52a) in fragment 2 (see MRR 1.57, note 3). Sempronius Atratinus in fragment 3 is independently attested as an augur (see Crawford, RRC 1.533, no. 530, 39? B.C.), while in fragment 4, if Scaurus is accepted as an augur and succeeded by Scipio Asiagenes (338), Cos. 83, in 88, difficulties arise in dating the well-attested augurate of Sulla at the same time, since it was illegal for two members of the same gens to be augurs together (Dio 39.17). The further point, brought by Geer (op. cit.), that the charge Domitius brought against Scaurus (Ascon.) that sacra publica populi Romani quae Lavini fierent opera eius minus recte casteque fieri, more properly implies that he was, exercising the functions of a pontifex than of an augur. It is well known that pontifices were connected with the cult at Lavinium, but the reason why Scaurus incurred special danger is not clear. Badian, noting Asconius' close acquaintance with the trial as support for Scaurus' augurate, supposes that he had some close personal relationship with the cult (Arethusa 1, 1968, 30-31), a position supported by E. Rawson (Phoenix 28, 1974, 209, note 106), because the tense of fieri implies a present and continuing failure in the conduct of the rites, not simply some past official act. In an appendix on the problem of Scaurus' offense, J. Scheid (MEER 93, 1981, 168-171, cf. 124125) notes that while texts on the annual sacrifice to the Penates and Vesta mention pontifices and consuls, there is no mention of augurs (Schol. Veron. Verg. Aen. 1.239** cf. Ser. Aen. 2.296** Macrob. Sat. 3.4.11), but remains uncertain about Scaurus' priesthood. See also, from the point of view of political rivalries, Gruen, RFCC 173-174.[10x][11x]
"An interval between quaestorship and tribunate during which he reformed is suggested by Diodorus (36.12** cf. Gruen, RPCC 163, note 35). Sumner (Orators 119) notes also the rule (which Saturninus might have circumvented) which prevents magistrates in office from becoming candidates before expiration of their term (Mommsen, StR 1?.531-535). But his replacement in charge of the grain supply at Ostia by no less a person than the Princeps Senatus, M. Aemilius Scaurus (MRR 1.560), points to a time of crisis. While 105 was such a year (Gran. Lic. 33.25-27, ed. Criniti p. 12), the defeat at Arausio (late in 105) and the effect on the annona of the slave revolt in Sicily point more strongly to 104 than to 105 (Sumner, loc. cit.). Crawford (RRC 1.323-324, no. 317) dates his coinage to 104. Tribune of the Plebs, 103, 100. The grain law of Saturninus should more probably be dated to his first tribunate in 103 than to his second in 100, as in MRR 1.575, 578, note 3, and may be considered a measure to meet conditions caused by the slave revolt in Sicily, perhaps also a response to his removal from that charge when quaestor at Ostia in 104 (MRR 1.560** see above). A date in 103 is favored by Last (CAH 9.165), Passerini (Athenaeum 12, 1934, 107143), and Balsdon (PBSR 14, 1938, 98-114, who would admit even 104). See below, on the quaestorships of L.  Calpurnius Piso (Caesoninus) (89) and Q. Servilius Caepio (50). The settlement of Marian veterans in Africa after .the Jugurthine war (MRR 1.563, 565, note 3) has been further confirmed by the discovery at Thuburnica  of an inscription honoring Marius as conditor coloniae (sic) (P. Quoniam, CRAI 1950, 383-386-AEpig. 1951,  no. 81). These settlements were dated to the first tribunate of Saturninus in 103 by E. Gabba (Athenaeum 29, 1951, 16, and note 1** and in his ed. of App. BC 1.29, 130) rather than 100, since he interpreted Cic. Balb. 48,  and Leg. 2.14, to mean that the legislation of 100 was annulled. Passerini (Athenaeum 12, 1934, 348351) and Badian (Gnomon 33, 1961, 495) hold that they mean the opposite** see now E. Gabba, Republican Rome, the Army and the Allies 199-200, note 167** J. Linderski, ""A Witticism of Appuleius Saturninus,"" RFIC 111, 1983, 457-458, note 1. The colony of Eporedia is not a test case since it was founded at the recommendation of the Xviri s. f. (Puny NH 3.123** Fraccaro, Opuscula 3.98** Gabba, Athenaeum 33, 1955, 225-230). In any case, given Marius' preference for' fresh troops for his campaigns in the north (Frontin. Str. 4.2.2), the African settlements may well be dated to 103. If so, the commissions to which C. Iulius Caesar Strabo (135) and C. Iulius Caesar (130), the dictator's father, belonged (see MRR 1.577 and 578, note 6) may be dated before 100, thus making room for earlier dates in their careers. Appian dates the death of Saturninus on the day after the consular  elections for 99 had begun with the murder of Glaucia's rival Memmius and the other disorders attendant upon Glaucia's illegal candidacy, and on the day of his own entrance upon his third tribunate (i.e., December 10, accepted in MRR 1.576). E. Gabba on Appian BC 1.32-33 expressed doubts (accepted by Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 494, and Historia 11, 1962, 219, note 87** and Gruen, Historia 15, 1966, 33, note 6, and RPCC 186-189) in favor of an earlier season, for the following reasons: (1) December is an unusually late date for consular elections** (2) C. Saufeius is termed a quaestor (see below)** (3) in Val. Max. 3.2.18, L. Equitius is described as tribunus plebis designatus, while according to Cicero (Rab. Perd. 20) all the tribunes except Saturninus were called by the SCU to the defense of the state** (4) P. Furius, who is described in Dio 28, fr. 95.3, as a supporter of Saturninus who later deserted him, would on Appian's dating be a tribune of 99 (see below, on P. Furius [22])** and (5) the text of Auct. Vir. Ill. 73.10, as well as the cutting of the water conduits to the Capitoline, point to a warmer season than December. R. Seager has countered most of these points in CR 18, 1968, 9-10. In the pre- Sullan period elections late in the year are not so surprising. The reading of the text in Auct. Vir. Ill., maximo aestu, is merely an emendation of the unintelligible mss readings questu and gusto (astu might be possible). There is no evidence that P. Furius was a colleague when he was supporting Saturninus, and prompt action will explain his actions between December 10 and the end of Marius' consular year, One item remains unexplained and may be decisive** C. Saufeius (3** see MRR 2.2), if quaestor in 100, would no longer be in office on December 10, since his term had ended on December 5, and he could not be quaestor designate for 99, for at his death the consular elections for 99 had not yet been completed and so, although presumably tribunes and aediles of the plebs had been elected earlier, the elections for praetors, curule aediles, and quaestors had not yet been held. Saufeius' quaestorship points to a date before December 5, 100. On Saufeius, see also Badian, Chiron 14, 1984, 101-147, esp. 106. Badian interprets the recourse of Saturninus and his associates to the Capitolium as an attempt, after Glaucia's illegal candidacy was refused (Cic. Brut. 224, si rationem eius haberi licere iudicatum esset, presumably by Marius), to call an assembly there and secure for him an exemption from the leges annales. If the date given by Appian and accepted in MRR for the deaths of Saturninus and his associates should be placed earlier in the year, as seems very probable, the dates of other magistrates should be changed as follows:[20x][21x]"
"See MRR 2.47, 52, note 5. If, as seems very[120x] probable, he was the quaestor (App. BC 1.57) who, alone among Sulla's officers, continued loyal to him in his march on Rome, the date should be 88. See Badian, Studies 153, note 10, 220** Sumner, Orators 178.  Proquaestor in Greece and Asia, 87-80. See the list of honors he received, made by L. and J. Robert (Bull. Epig. 1970, no. 441), as # and # from 87 to 80, while under Sulla, from Athens, Delos, Synnada, Thyatira, Hypata, and Delphi. Praetor 78. In a passage that cites various examples of praetorian activity Dio (36.41.1-4) tells of the calmness with which a praetor # suffered the breaking of his curule chair by M'. Acilius Glabrio. The name Lucullus, the reading of all the MSS, is regularly emended to #, and the incident dated to the consulship of Acilius in 67 (MRR 2.143), but J. M. David and M. Dondin keep the manuscript reading, and place the incident in Lucullus' praetorship in 78, and so place there an otherwise unattested tribunate of Acilius Glabrio (MEFR 92, 1980, 199-219** see above, on M'. Acilius Glabrio [36], Cos. 67). As 78 falls within the period of the reduced tribunate, an Acilius is a rather improbable candidate for that time. Note that if the view of David and Dondin is correct, it would be Lucullus who refused the province of Sardinia the next year and later received Africa (Dio). Aed. cur. 79. In MRR 2.85, note 2, note that L. Lucullus waited for his brother's year (Plut. Luc. 1.6), which according to the normal working of the Leges Annales was 79. Lucullus advanced immediately to the  praetorship legis praemio (Cic. Acad. 2.1). (TJC) Proconsul and imperator, 73-63. Note honors he received from Andros and Naxos (Bull. Epig. 1970, no. 441** J. M. Reynolds, JRS 66, 1976, 178). The date of Mithridates'  siege of Cyzicus, and his defeat by Lucullus, has remained in dispute: was it in the winter of 74/73 as favored in MRR 1.106-108, or in that of 73/72, as in Magie, RRAM 1204-5, note 5? It has been noted that the order of the fragments of Diodorus (37-38, 22 b) which record the siege of Cyzicus after the assassination of Sertorius in Spain in 72 (73?) suggests that Diodorus placed the siege in the winter of 73/72. Two recent studies assert a date in 73/72 on the basis of the coins of Nicomedes IV, and one of them also shows how news of the death of Sertorius in Spain which, if correctly reported, reached Cyzicus while the siege was going on (App. Mith. 72) is evidence for a date in 73/72 and also for the death of Sertorius in 73, rather than 72 as usually assumed. See G. Per], ""Zur Chronologie der Kînigreiche Bithynia, Pontus, and Bosporus,"" Studien zur Geschichte and Philosophie des Altertums 299-330** W. H. Bennett, ""The Death of Sertorius and the Coin,"" Historia 10, 1961, 459-469. The annual numbers on the coins of the Bithynian kings begin with the autumn of 297 and continue to no. 224 on the latest coins of Nicomedes IV. Given this indication that Nicomedes did not die until late in 74, unless, possibly, some issue of his coinage continued after his death, and Eutropius' statement (6.6) that it was in the consulship of Lucullus and Cotta, there remains quite insufficient time for the operations of Iuncus (MRR 2.98) and the publicans in Bithynia, and the military preparations of Lucullus and Cotta, unless they had much   of 73 at their disposal. In any case, Mithridates did not begin his advance until the spring after Nicomedes' death (App. Mith. 70). A shrewd estimate of coming trouble may be sufficient to explain the assignments of the  eastern commands to the consuls (Cic. Mur. 33** Plut. Luc. 5-6** App. Mith. 72), and still confirm the implication of Cicero, Acad. 2.1, post ad Mithridaticum bellum missus a senatu. If so, the transfer of his legion to Asia Minor, the organization of his army, and his advance into Phrygia before proceeding to attack Mithridates at Cyzicus should be dated to 73. The same dating may hold for the actions of Cotta to protect the Bosporus, the Propontis, and the coasts of Bithynia (MRR 2.210). See above, on M. Aurelius Cotta (107), and below, on Cn. Pompeius Magnus (31) and Q. Sertorius (5). The activities of Lucullus may be assigned to the years from 73 to 69 as follows: 73	Beginning of hostilities. Defeat of Cotta at Chalcedon. Siege of Cyzicus begins. 73/72	Cyzicus relieved. Defeat of Mithridates. 72	Naval victory. Bithynia cleared. Flight of Mithridates to Pontus. Cotta besieges Heracleia. Lucullus begins invasion of Pontus. 72/71	Siege of Amisus begins. Mithridates in Cabira raises a new army. Rout of the Pontic fleet. 71	Engagements about Cabira. Mithridates abandons Cabira. Pontus occupied. Capture of Amisus and of Heracleia. 70	Financial reforms in Asia. Sinope and Amasea surrender. Lucullus asks the Senate to send an organizing commission. 69	Invasion of Armenia. Addendum. See B. C. McGing, Phoenix 38, 1984, 12-18, who points out that the presence of Lucullus in Rome in 74 until after the elections (Cic. Cluent. 137) and the sorry state of the troops he found in Asia Minor (Plut. Luc. 7.1-2) are strong indications in favor of dating the siege of Cyzicus to the winter of 73-72.[121x]"
"Son of Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius (98), Cos. 80, by testamentary adoption, he made, as Shackleton Bailey notes, frequent use of the cognomen Scipio but none of Nasica (Studies 107-110). The election in the spring of 60, in which he defeated Favonius, who promptly prosecuted him, probably for ambitus, remains a puzzle (Cic. Att. 2.1.9, early in June). As it was too early in the year for the regular elections for 59, it .must have been held for the election of a suffect magistrate. L. R. Taylor's view that Metellus Scipio thus became an aedilis suffectus for the rest of 60 (Ullman Studies 79- 85) is unsatisfactory since, Favonius did not reach the aedileship until 52 (MRR 2.235, 240, note 2). So, too, is a tribunate of the plebs, which I accepted in MRR .2.189, since a suffect tribune newly elected within his year of office would normally have entered upon office at once, and would have been exempt from prosecution during it (Weinrib, Phoenix 22, 1968, 33, note 8** Sumner, Orators 112). Moreover, Metellus Scipio's position as a tribune of the plebs seems quite inconsistent with his holding of the patrician office of interrex in 53 (ILLRP 1046**  MRR 2.29** Sumner, loc. cit.). It was, however, Alford's suggestion (CR 41, 1927, 216-218), and appealed both  to Chr. Meier (Historia 10, 1961, 96-98) and to Shackleton Bailey (CLA 1.350351), who later favored an aedileship (Phoenix 24, 1970, 164). Sumner, rejecting a tribunate, opted for a quaestorship (Orators 112), while Wiseman, thinking the quaestorships too numerous and too unimportant for such a struggle, returned to the tribunate (JRS. 65, 1975, 198, rev. of Sumner). For Metellus Scipio, born ca. 95, a quaestorship in 60 seems  long delayed, but appears to suit conditions best. Neither a quaestorship nor a tribunate in 60 would affect dating his possible aedileship to 57 (MRR 2.201). Praetor 55, Proconsul 54? Metellus' triumph is mentioned in Varro RR 3.2.16 as no longer so recent (ut tunc fuit). The dramatic date of this book now appears to be 50, as Ap. Claudius Pulcher was present as an augur. There were no aedilician elections in 54, and none in 53 until too late for him to be present, as he was away as proconsul in Cilicia (53-51)** cf. Varro RR 3.2.1-2** Badian, Athenaeum 48, 1970, 4-5. Badian suggests that Metellus held an otherwise unknown province after his praetorship, but Shatzman, rejecting the aedileship, dates the praetorship and the province in 56 and 55. Badian (loc. cit.) observes that the preserved fragment of the Fast. Triumph. shows no triumphs between Pompey in 61 and an unknown in 54 (Degrassi, Inscr. Ital. 13.1.85, 566). This unknown is taken to be Pomptinus (MRR 2.225), who celebrated a triumph in 54, but could be Metellus, or Pomptinus could precede him. J. S. Richardson (CQ 33, 1983, 456-463) would date his triumph to 54, or at the latest before June 53, and so suggests a praetorship in 56, and his aedileship, if he held one, earlier than his games in 57. He believes that the dramatic date of Varro RR 3 is ""best placed before 53"" since Appius Claudius Pulcher (297), Cos. 54, who participates in this dialogue as augur at the time of an aedilician election, was away from Rome early 53 to late in 51 as proconsul in Cilicia. In answer to the objection that there were no elections of curule magistrates in 54, nor in 53 until July, he suggests that in the case of such long delays exceptions might be made to the regular order of election to permit the election of aediles and quaestors. He offers as examples the possible election of C. Cassius Longinus (59) and M. Iunius Brutus (53) to quaestorships in 53. But Cassius could have been elected in 55 to office in 54 (see below, on him, and Linderski, CPh 70, 1975, 35-37), and so, too, could Brutus, whose quaestorship is mentioned only in Auct. Vir. Ill. 82.3-4 (see the Supplement, below, on M. Iunius Brutus [58]). The dramatic date of Varro RR 3 is more probably 50, as Varro is not mentioned in his command in Spain until the beginning of 49 (MRR 2.253, 269). We can assume that Appius Claudius, though censor in 50, could continue to function as an augur too. At any rate, the Villa Publica would not be a strange place for a censor. See now J. Linderski, ""The Dramatic Date of Varro De Re Rustica, Book III, and the Elections in 54,"" Historia 34, 1985, 248-254, who holds that the opposition between tunc and nunc in Varro RR 3.2.15-16 is decisively in favor of a date for Metellus' triumph in 54 or 53 and a dramatic date in 50 for Varro's Book III. Proconsul in Africa, 48-46. On the coins inscribed Q. Metel, with Plus below, and Scipio Imp on the reverse, see now Crawford, RRC 1.471, 473, nos. 459-462, 47-46 B.C.[41x][42]"
"As a solution for the difficulties in the augural succession .in this period Badian (Arethusa 1, 1968, 31-33), following Mommsen, suggests excising as erroneous the phrase in Livy 27.6.15 Ti. Sempronius Ti. f. Longus augur factus in locum T. Otacilii Crassi, thus removing from this place in the college of augurs a Sempronius whose presence would result in the cooptation  of another Sempronius, a Gracchus, in 204, during his tenure (until 174, Livy 41.21.8-9** MRR 1.282-283, 407, notes 4 and 5, 309). Livy reports this cooptation in 204 (29.38.7) of a Gracchus, admodum adulescens, and records the deaths, both of Longus and of this Gracchus in 174 (41.21.8-9). He lists as successor T. Veturius Gracchus Sempronianus, whom Geer (and I) proposed to rename Ti. Sempronius Gracchus Veturianus on the ground that the Veturii were patrician and only plebeian places were available at that time in the college of augurs (Geer, AJPh 60, 1939, 466-467** cf. MRR 1.405, 407, notes 4 and 5), and the name would then represent the adoption of a patrician by a plebeian. Badian points out the possibility of a line of plebeian Veturii descending from Veturius Calvinus (8), Cos. 321 (op. cit. 34), and defends the name as given in Livy,  explaining the intrusive word Gracchus as either coming from his predecessor or representing the words Gracchi f. His place in the augural college would not prevent the cooptation of the summus augur, the consul of 177 and 163, and father of the Gracchi, at some date between 174 and 163. Sumner, noting that the Sempronius  Gracchus who was an augur from 204 to 174 would in any case have reached the age for a praetorship before his death in 174 (""not old enough to reach high office and come to our notice,"" Badian 33), suggests that the notice of his death in 174 was a mistake: he was the consul of 177 and 163 and had been adopted by a Veturius to  avoid having two Sempronii in the college at the same, time, just as Lentulus Spinther was adopted by a Manlius in 57 (Dio 39.17), and, like Lentulus, continued for ordinary purposes to use his original name (Orators 38-39** for other examples of continued use, see Shackleton Bailey, Studies, esp. 109, 113-114). Tr. pl. 187. Livy (38.52-60), with Valerius Antias as his source, places Gracchus' tribunate in 187. This date avoids the difficulty raised if, as I was inclined to hold in MRR, 1.376, 378, note 4, Gracchus was a member of an embassy to Greece in 185-184 (1.373, and 374, note 7). Scullard (Roman Politics. 142-145, 290-303) places the tribunate of Gracchus in 187, and with him his colleagues Fannius (6) and Minucius Augurinus (30) (1.375-376), and puts the trial of L. Scipio in the same year. In 184 the attack was directed against Africanus. This seems to me the best solution of the problem. Praetor and proconsul in Hisp. Cit. 180, 179-178. Founder of Graccuris (App. Ib. 43), and apparently also founder (deductor) of Iliturgis (A. Blanco and G. Lachica, AEArq 1960, 193-196** A. d'Ors, Akte des IV. int. Kong. gr. u. lat. Epig. 304-305** Acta 5th Int. Congress Gr. & Lat. Epig. 256, in answer  to A. Degrassi, Epigraphica III-Scritti Vari 3.129ff., who notes that the lettering cannot be earlier than the late Republic).

"Coins inscribed QME. In MRR 2.433, and Index, 539, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.253, no. 211, 155-149 B.C. Aedile ca. 152. A decree of the Thessalian League, recently discovered at Larisa, and presented by K. I. Gallis, Ephor of Antiquities, the Archaeological Museum of Larisa, in a communication to the 8th Internat. Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy in Athens, 1982, pp. 28-29 of the program, is inscribed in honor of Q. Caecilius Q. f. Metellus, most probably the future consul of 143. He is honored as aedile (#), therefore at a date in the late 150s. He had, in a most unusual proceeding, come to Larisa himself in a time of scarcity in order to arrange for the collection and transport of a large quantity of grain (430,000 koinoi) to Rome and to make payment for both grain and transport. On the activity of curule aediles in connection with the grain supply, see Livy 30.26.5-6** 31.50.1** 33.42.8. See below, on Metellus Nepos (95), G. Manganaro, Chiron 13, 1983, 405-409, and P. Garnsey, T. Gallant, and D. Rathbone, ""Thessaly and the Grain Supply of Rome during the Second Century B.C.,"" JRS 74, 1984, 30-44. Praetor 148, and proconsul 147-146. Because continuous military action in Macedonia and Greece left little or no time for provincial organization before the succession of L. Mummius in 146, M. G. Morgan holds that the organization of Macedonia as well as of Greece was largely due to the latter and the ten commissioners (Historia 18, 1969, 422-446). Hyampolis made a dedication to Metellus with the title #. For other evidence of this title, see Morgan, loc. cit. From the spoils he built a porticus Metelli in circo Flaminio, and within it probably two temples, one of Jupiter Stator and one to Juno Regina (Veil. 1.11.3-5** Pliny, NH 34.31** 36.40** Vitruv. 3.2.5** see M. G. Morgan, Hermes 99, 1971, 480-505). Special command, ca. 133. With Cn. Servilius Caepio (46), Cos. 141, he crushed a slave uprising at Minturnae and Sinuessa (Oros. 5.9.4** cf. Obsequens 27b** see Badian, Historia 6, 1957, 321). On his censorship, see L. Hayne, Historia 27, 1978, 234- 235. Addendum. This volume was already in proof when the article by P. Garnsey and D. Rathbone, ""The Background of the Grain Law of Gaius Gracchus"" (JRS 75, 1985, 20-25), became available to me. On the basis of the names and the probable dates of the Strategoi of the Koinon of Thessaly, found in decrees inscribed without paragraphing by the same hand on the same stone as the grain inscription, the authors suggest ca. 135- 129 as the date. The only Q. Caecilius Q. f. Metellus available at that time is Balearicus (82), Cos. 123, who, if he was an aedile, must have held that office by 129. All three of the Metelli considered, Macedonicus, Balearicus, and Q. Caecilius Q. f. Q. n. Metellus Nepos (95), Cos. 98, probably held an aedileship, but it is not otherwise attested for any of them. See also E. S. Gruen, The Hellenistic World and the Coming of Rome, I, 164-165, note 44, who favors Balearicus."
In MRR 2.447 (with date to 63), and Index, 595, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.445-446, no. 421 (Sufenas), 59 B.C. Quaestor. Date uncertain, since his coinage, issued SC, provides no evidence that he was then a quaestor (Crawford, RRC loc. Cit., and 1.88, note 3). Tr. Pl. 56? His tribunate is an inference from his prosecution in 54, along with the tribune of 56, C. Porcius Cato (6) for ambitus and/or interference with the elections (Cic. Att. 4.15.4** cf. 4.16.5-6** see Gruen, LGRR 314-315), most probably the former, as he, Cato, and Procilius (q.v.) were all tried in different quaestiones the same day. See L. R. Taylor, Athenaeum 42, 1964, 12-28, esp. 19, note 19** and J. Linderski, Studi E. Volterra 2.281-302, esp. 284ff. and 302. Praetor 55? His praetorship and its date depend on three factors: first, moving the curule aedileship of Cn. Plancius and A. Plautius from 54, as in MRR 2.223, to 55, removes the possibility that Nonius could have held it then (cf. 2.216) (unless perhaps he was an aedile of the plebs, since they also had curule chairs after Sulla** L. R. Taylor, AJPh 60, 1939, 194-202** see below)** second, delay of the elections for 55 to an interregnum in the early part of that year, when the new consuls Pompey and Crassus could aid their supporters (Dio 39.32), made it possible for a tribune of 56, leaving office by December 10, to become a candidate for a curule magistracy, be it aedileship or praetorship, in 55 (see below, on Cn. Plancius and A. Plautius)** third, and least certain, it is necessary to identify Sufenas with the Nonius Struma in Catullus 52 (Sella in curuli Struma Nonius sedet),  taking the word struma as a nickname and assuming that the Leges Annales allowed Sufenas to advance from tribunate to praetorship (Taylor, and Linderski, above). This fits in nicely, in view of the senatorial decree of 53 which created an interval of five years between office in Rome and provincial command, with the governorship of a M. Nonius (2.343) in an eastern province, probably Macedonia, in 51 and 50 (Shackleton Bailey, CLA 3.246, on Att. 6.1.13), or the imperium of a Sufenas who is listed in Att. 8.15.3, as having a military command  in March 49, but hardly with both (Shackleton Bailey, loc. Cit.). There may therefore have been two contemporary Nonii, apart from the Nonii Asprenates, who do not appear until 46. Both must have attained to praetorships and one (Struma) almost certainly before the death of Catullus (54?). The cognomen may help to identify the career of the other. As Cn. Tremellius Scrofa had been given charge in 52-51 of a minor eastern province, probably Crete and Cyrene, the M. Nonius named in Att. 6.1.13 was governor of Macedonia (Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.246). Against L. R. Taylor?s identification of Sufenas with Struma Nonius (see above), Shackleton Bailey notes that Sufenas was one of a number of Pompeians who held imperium in Italy in March 49 (Att. 8.15.3) and identifies ?Struma? Nonius with the provincial governor.[148x]
"See MRR 1.496-497, note 1. In this note I accepted Passerini's view that the date of the SC de agro Pergameno was 129 (for the text, see now Sherk, RDGE, no. 12, pp. 63-73) in the belief that the consuls mentioned in the fragments, one with a name ending in ?nius and the other with a name ending in ?illius, were colleagues in the same year and thus necessarily in 129, when M'. Aquillius (10) as consul was occupied in completing the pacification and the organization of the province of Asia (MRR 1.504). Passerini's date, based on the two copies of the SC, has been accepted by many scholars (see the list in Sherk, op. cit., and now in F. De Martino, ""Il Senatus Consulto de Agro Pergameno,"" PP, fasc. 210, 1983, 161-190) but was rejected by Magie (RRAM 2.1025, note 25), who held that 129 was too soon for disputes with the publicans to require settlement and suggested that the one consul named in office (line 17) might be the younger Aquillius (11), Cos. 101. This view has found fresh support from H.. B. Mattingly, AJPh 93, 1972, 412-423, with arguments based mainly on the dates when formulae in the text began to be used, and a prosopographical study of the names of members of the commission preserved on the stones. While F. de Martino, in his recent valuable study cited above, shows that these are insufficient criteria, since the formulae do appear earlier than Mattingly thought, and in the absence of cognomina prosopographical arguments remain uncertain, he holds that, even though certainty seems impossible, the consulship of the younger Aquillius (101 B.C.) is the more probable date. The decision to be made is about what land is subject to collection of taxes by the publicans. It may be only land of the city of Pergamum, but the discovery of fragments of the SC as far north as Adramyttium and as far south as Smyrna suggests the need of a more general settlement applicable to a wider territory, rather than a smaller one, such as defining the limits of royal land, now become ager publicus, a possibility that would be more likely before the legislation of Gaius Gracchus. This view is supported also by the unusual size of the senatorial commission (fifty-five names are known). I am still inclined to think that the consuls mentioned in lines 9 and 17 could have been colleagues in the same year, but must  agree that a date such as 101 is quite possible. Accordingly, the dating in MRR of the names of the members of the senatorial commission to 129 should be queried. Addendum. See now E. Badian, ""Two Notes on Senatus Consulta concerning Pergamum"" (LCM 11, 1986, 14-16), who identifies C. Coelius C. f. Aemilia (listed tenth in the consilium) with C. Coelius C. f. C. n. Caldus (12), Cos. 94. As this Coelius was a ""new man"" (Cic. De Or. 1.117** Comm. Pet. 11), this identification supports the later date proposed for the SC, 101 B.C."
A tantalizing fragment of an Elogium, inscribed in letter forms  of the first century after Christ, was found late in 1950 in Brundisium at the probable site of the ancient forum. It was first published by F. Ribezzo (II Carrocio del Sud, n.s. 2, 1951, 4ff.), and later by G. Vitucci (RFIC 31, 1953, 43-61). The text, with Vitucci's admittedly uncertain supplements, reads as follows: Primus senatum legit et comiti[a ordinavit M. Iunio Pera M.] Barbula cos. circumsedit vi [cepitque Tarentum praesi] diumque Hannibalis et prae[dam ingentem. Solus a viris] militaribus praecipuam glor[iam cunctando sibi paravit.] Vitucci considers it an Elogium of M. Fabius Maximus Cunctator and would refer the first phrases to his censorship in 230 with the suggestion that they place the reform of the centuriate assembly at that time. L. R. Taylor (AJPh 78, 1957, 351-353), while holding that this reform belongs to the censorship of 241 (Liv. Per. 20) when the last two tribes were created, refers these phrases to the achievement of Fabius as censor in 230 in being the first to complete these duties in one year or one consulship. Earlier censors had carried through lections of  the Senate. The relation of the inscription to the colony of Brundisium is not clear, nor yet the reason for omission of much of the material in other Elogia of the Cunctator. Gabba's interpretation that the inscription honors a local magistrate of the first period of the colony (founded ca. 244 B.C.) has much to recommend it (Athenaeum 36, 1958, 90-105). He suggests the following text: Primus senatum legit comiti[a instituit M. lunio Pera M. Aemilio] Barbula co(n)s(ulibus). Circumsedit Vi[binum bello punico secundo praesi] diumque Hannibalis et prae[fectum eius cepit. Victor in rebus] militaribus praecipuam glor[iam sibi comparavit.] Thus the inscription presents, like a recently discovered one at Tarquinia, an example of memories of old local history still living and tenacious in the imperial period. Recently R. Develin, noting that the second part of the censorship of Ap. Claudius Caecus, the time of the first record of a lection of the Senate by the censors, coincided with the consulship in 311 of an Aemilius Barbula (34), suggested that he was the person honored (Historia 25, 1976, 484-487). Claudius' registration of the freedmen could not help but affect the comitia. However, it is difficult to find a suitable occasion then for engagements with Carthaginians, although a treaty was renewed in 306. And in the period before the founding. of Brundisium there is no apparent reason for the location of the inscription. Others continue to hold for Fabius Cunctator: Vitucci in Studi Annibalici, Accad. Etrusca Cortona, Annuario 12, n.s. 5, 1961-64, 17-69, and Annal. Fac. Lett. Filos. Univ. Perugia 1, 1963-64, 3ff., and Degrassi, Acta 5th Internat. Congress Greek and Latin Epig. 1967, 161.[5x]
The coinage in gold and silver issued by Regulus and his fellow IIIIviri, P. Clodius M. f., L. Mussidius T. f. Longus, and C. V(e)ibius Va(a)rus, to which various dates have been ascribed from Caesar's death to 38 (see MRR 2.443), seems now firmly dated to 42 (Crawford, RRC 1.502-511, no. 494), and identified by triumviral portraits and names as early issues of triumviral gold and silver in that year (see T. V. Buttrey, The Triumviral Portrait Gold of the Quattuorviri Monetales of 42 B.C). A group of types (Crawford, RRC no. 494, nos. 26a to 31) bears the name of the IIIIvir Regulus and honors members of his  family without apparent reference to the triumvirs. These types present on the obverse a portrait with the inscription REGVLVS PR or L. REGVLVS PR, while on the reverse there appears the name of the monetalis with a curule chair and three fasces on either side (nos. 26a, 26b, both aurei, and the silver denarii, nos. 27 and 28), or a modius with corn ears (no. 29, a denarius), or a wild beast fight (no. 30, a denarius). But the reverse of no. 31 has, besides the curule chair with fasces on either side, the inscription REGVLVS F(ilius) above and PRAEF(ectus) UR(bi) below. There are therefore three functions and possibly as many as three persons to be distinguished. The praetor is pretty clearly the elder Regulus, father of the monetalis. He is almost certainly the man who befriended Cicero in 58 (Att. 3.17.1** Fam. 13.60.1** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 2.153-154). The coinage indicates that he attained the praetorship, and he may well be the officer whom Caesar after the battle of Thapsus left with a legion in charge of Hadrumetum (Bell. Afr. 89.3** MRR 2.303). The presence of the two inscriptions Regulus F(ilius) and Praef(ectus) Ur(bi) together on the reverse suggests that they might refer to the same person, though not necessarily, or even probably, to the holding of both offices in the same year, but it seems unlikely that a monetalis could have held previously so distinguished and senior an office. It is possible that the prefecture was held by a third party, but it seems more probable that the elder Regulus held this office too, most likely in 45, when Caesar left Rome in charge of many prefects and only the plebeian tribunes and aediles in office (see MRR 2.313). Note that, according to Dio (43.48.1-4** cf. Suet. Iul. 76.2), Caesar had done so in previous absences, and that these prefects had the fasces, curule chair, and dress of magistrates** but since ordinary republican magistrates were soon restored to their functions, it seems improbable that the practice took as institutional a form as Alfîldi described in ?Les praefecti urbi de Cesar? (Mel. Seston 1-13).
MÅnzer, in the belief that Varro did not avoid inconsistencies between the dramatic dates of the dialogues in Books I and II of the De Re Rustica (ca. January 56 for I, and 67 for II) and the career of the interlocutor Cn. Tremellius Scrofa, almost certainly combined, as P. A. Brunt and G. Perl have shown, the careers of two different individuals under the same name and number in RE (see MÅnzer, RE, and Hermes 61, 1926, 272-277** Brunt, CR 22, 1972, 304-308** Perl, AJAR 5, 1980, 97-109). The first and senior one, named above, was the agricultural authority, interlocutor in Books I and II, who claims to be the seventh of his gens to have attained the praetorship (2.4.2), and was a grandson of the Tremellius (see no. 6, below) who was quaestor under Licinius Nerva (130) in Macedonia in 143 or 142 (MRR 1.472), was the first to have the cognomen Scrofa (RR 2.4.1-2** Liv. Per. 53** Eutrop. 4.15** cf. Macrob. Sat. 1.6.30), and was a son of an otherwise unknown praetor (L. or Cn.?) of shortly before 100. He is described as follows in a group which contained Varro himself: et aetate et honore et scientia quod praestas (RR 1.3.1), and so was older and had attained office before Varro. He may have been born between 120 and 114, and have attained the quaestorship and the praetorship before him, quaestor ca. 87, as Perl conjectures, and praetor ca. 77, or perhaps 72, dates which would allow his command in Transalpine Gaul to be dated either before or after M. Fonteius (12), where there are gaps in the record (RR 1.7.8, In Gallia Transalpina intus, ad Rhenum cum exercitum ducerem** see Badian, Mel. Piganiol 901-913 for known governors and their dates** cf. Brunt, loc. Cit., and Perl, loc. Cit., above). His place with Varro on the board of XXviri under Caesar?s agrarian law is well attested (RR 1.2.10** cf. MRR 2.192). The dates on this record still admit that he could have been a magister of C. Lucilius Hirrus, Tr. Pl. 53, in his youth (RR 2.1.2). The second and younger Cn. Tremellius Scrofa (born ca. 101) was a quaestor under Crassus in 71 (Plut. Crass. 11.4, #), juror, and therefore a senator, in the trial of Verres in 70, and at that time a military tribune elect for 69 ( Verr. 1.30** cf. MRR 2.133). The date of his praetorship remains uncertain, perhaps ca. 60 or the early 50s, if he held a proconsulate in 51-50 (Cic. Att. 5.4.2** 6.1.13** cf. 7.8.1), which Shackleton Bailey suggests was Crete and Cyrene because it was so insignificant and gave so little opportunity (CLA 3.246). This is denied by Perl because he was so much in Rome, but mention in Att. 6.1.13 with other governors is strongly in favor of a provincial command.
Praefectus fabrum under Caesar in Gaul (58-50) and perhaps with him in subsequent years, a Roman eques. From Formiae, wealthy and notorious for his display, prodigality, and outrageous conduct (Plin. NH 36.48 from Nepos** cf. Catull. 29, 41, 43, 57** Hor. Sat. 1.5.37** Suet. Iul. 73** Cic. Att. 7.7.6, 13.52** and see C. Nicolet, Ordre equestre 2.940-941, no. 219). Mention in Catull. 29 of praeda Pontica, inde tertia Hibera suggests that he had seen service in the East under Pompey in the Third Mithridatic War, and later service with Caesar during his command in Hisp. Ult. In 61-60, but W. C. McDermott offers the interpretation that the mention of praeda refers rather to the fortunes made by Mamurra as a business man active in the purchase and sale of booty before he became Caesar?s prefect (RhM 126, 1983. 293-307** cf. Maid 35, 1983, 13-14). The occurrence of the name M. Vitruvius Mamurra at Thibilis in Africa (ILS 5566), the fact that Mamurra and the author of the De Architectura were near contemporaries, and also that the author, who had travelled widely, had associations with Julius Caesar and Augustus over a considerable period, led P. Thielscher in an extended discussion to the conclusion that Mamurra and Vitruvius were one and the same person (RE 9A.417-489). In an equally detailed response P. Ruffel and J. Soubiran (?Vitruve ou Mamurra?? Pallas 11, 1962, 123-179) point to the variety of cognomina found with the gentilicium Vitruvius, and the indication in one ancient authority, Cetius Faventinus, that his name may have been Vitruvius Pollio (pp. 130, 145). The details of the careers, they find, match in time, but never impinge upon each other (143-159). There is no evidence that Vitruvius was an eques or held a prefectship** and, if they were the same, it is strange that Pliny, who knew about both (Vitruvius is listed among his authorities for Book 36 of the Naturalis Historia), gives no hint that he thought so. Moreover, Vitruvius? own remarks in the prefaces to the books of the De Architectura present a humane person, modest in status and possessions, in spirit and aims, but devoted to his subject, who is quite inconsistent with what our sources present in Mamurra. On Mamurra, see J. Suolahti, Junior Officers 216, 266-267, 324, 371, 406. Note also R. E. A. Palmer, ?On the Track of the Ignoble,? Athenaeum 61, 1983, 343-361, presenting the possibility that they were relatives. Vitruvius was known to Frontinus (Aq. 25) simply as Vitruvium architectum who had probably worked under Agrippa.[133x]
The discovery at S. Onofrio (Catanzaro), a little to the northeast of Vibo Valentia, of an inscribed milestone on what has been known as the Via Popillia, has aroused continuing discussion. The inscription, CCLX I T. Annius T. f. I Pr. (ILLRP 454a), is taken to refer to the praetorship, not otherwise directly attested, of the consul of 128, and so must be dated by or before 131. The name Annius raises the question whether the road (the distances are counted from Capua to Rhegium) was built by P. Popillius Laenas (28), Cos. 132, and whether he was the one who set up the acephalous Polla inscription (CIL 1?.2.638-ILS 23-ILLRP 454). Both are attributed to him because he did build a Via Popillia, and Polla is near the site of Forum Popillii. See L. Pitimada, NS 1953, 343f. and AEpig. 1955, no. 191, for publication of the inscription** and for discussions of the road-building of Popillius and Annius in connection with the program of the Gracchan Commission (boundary stones of their survey have been found near Polla), see A. Degrassi (Ist. Ven. Sc. Lett. Art., Atti del Convegno del Retroterra Veneziano, 1956, 35-40** Philologus 99, 1955, 259-265-Scritti vari 2.1027-1033 and 1035-1040, resp.). Degrassi has Annius succeed Popillius in charge of the  road, and attributes to him also the Via Annia which connected Aquileia with the south, Forum Annii in Lucania (Sall. Hist. 3.98 M), and the Via Annia in Etruria (see above, on Annius Luscus [63, 64], Cos. 153, for Wiseman's view). V. Bracco, RAAN 29, 1955, 5-42 (not available to me) attributes the southern road to the consul of 153, as the one first to act in Lucania, and to convert ager scripturarius there to ager vectigalis. Wiseman however attributes the southern road to the praetor of 131, and J. M. Reynolds (JRS 61, 1971, 139) finds that the arguments sum up against Degrassi, and more in favor of supporters of the praetor of 131. According to G. P. Verbrugghe, Ap. Claudius Pulcher (295), Cos. 143, was the author of both the road and the inscription (CPh 68, 1973, 25-35). See below, on Claudius Pulcher (295). Annius' praetorship may be dated also before 131. See also V. Bracco, Archeol. Storia Calabria Lucania, 1965-66, 151-163 (not available to me)** A. Degrassi, Acta 5th Internat. Congress Gr. and Lat. Epig. 160** T. P. Wiseman, PBSR 37, 1969, 82-91.

Sumner (Orators 28-29) notes that the calm elections described in Livy (10.11.10) are inconsistent with those described in Cicero (Brut. 55), and so would place the tribunate of Dentatus, not in 298 (MRR 1.174), but in one of the other two years when Appius  Claudius was interrex, preferably the known interregnum of 291. He cites as a parallel the case of C. Marcius Rutilus Censorinus, Tr. pl. 311, Cos. 310 (MRR 1.161). In the operations against the Senones at the siege of Arretium in 283, in which the ex-consul Metellus Denter met defeat and death, Curius received command, not as praetor suffectus (MRR 1.188), but perhaps as a temporary emergency commander, like L. Marcius in Spain in 211 (MRR 1.275** see J. H. Corbett, Historia 20, 1971, 656-664). M. G. Morgan, however, remarks that Polybius uses the word # only of men chosen to succeed others in a properly constituted election. Curius, who has been brought into the tradition in Polybius from Fabius Pictor, should be connected only with the foundation of Sena, which Morgan would date ca. 289 as implied in Liv. Per. 11, and removed from commands against the Gauls. Morgan's reconstruction of the commands in this war with Gauls and Etruscans runs as follows:[284. When Gallic Senones and Boii concluded an alliance with Etruscans and began the siege of Arretium, Metellus Denter, the consul, was sent to relieve the town. He attempted negotiations with the Gauls through envoys, whom they murdered (winter 284-283).[283. Metellus Denter, now proconsul, was defeated and killed with much of his forces. See also Walbank, Comm. Poly& 3.760-761** R. M. Errington, JRS 57, 1967, 96ff., esp. 101-102, 104-107. P. Cornelius Dolabella (139), sent as consul after Metellus' death, met the combined forces of Gauls and Etruscans at Lake Vadimon, crushed them, ravaged their lands, and celebrated a triumph de Gallis Senonibus (Degrassi, Inscr. Ital. 13.1.345). His colleague as consul, Cn. Domitius Calvinus Maximus (45) inflicted a further defeat on Gauls and Etruscans and is credited with a triumph (Degrassi, op. cit.).[282. Q. Aemilius Papus (112), Cos. 282 and 278, defeated forces of Gauls and Etruscans at Vetulonia, after which the Gauls asked for a treaty of peace. The evidence is contradictory, and this a consistent arrangement, but there is still some reason to query one that goes so far from Polybius. See M. G. Morgan, CQ 22, 1972, 309- 325.[78x]
See MRR 2.236, 242. His quaestorship, in spite of uncertain evidence in Cicero (Phil. 2.49-50** cf. Mil. 40), should be dated to 51, not 52. Given that he was born on January 14, 83, he had met the age requirement for 52, and, owing to the extreme lateness of the elections for 53, was eligible even for that year (see A. Degrassi, Inscr. Ital. 13.2.397-8** G. V. Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 363). After his service as praef. eq. under Gabinius in Syria (MRR 2.205, 213, 220), he went to Caesar in Gaul, probably in 54, and returned from there to Rome with Caesar's support in 53 to run for the quaestorship of 52, and became involved in the disorderly struggle between Clodius and Milo (Cic. Phil. 48-49** Mil. 40). After the death of Clodius he appears as a subscriptor in April 52, to the accusation against Milo (Ascon. 41C), at a moment when the magistrates for 52, with the exception of one consul, had all been elected (Ascon. 37C, on the election of the triumviri capitales, the lowest and last on the list). There is no further mention of candidacy for 52 or of office in that year. The elections for 51 were probably held in the early autumn of 52, after which Antonius, chosen as Caesar?s quaestor sine sorte, departed for Gaul without waiting for legal formalities to be completed (Cic. Phil. 2.50** Att. 6.6.4** Fam. 2.15.4). In autumn 52 Caesar terms him legatus (BG 7.81.6), but late in 52 and during 51 his title is quaestor (Hirtius in BG 8.2.1, 24.2, and 38.1), then in 50 it reverts to legatus (BG 8.46.4** cf. 47.2, 48.1). In BG 8.50.1-3 emphasis on his relation to Caesar brings back the title quaestor** cf. Pompey in Cicero,  Au. 7.8.5, when Antonius was already a tribunus llebes. See J. Linderski and Anna Kaminska-Linderski, Phoenix 28, 1974, 213-223** and Shackleton Bailey, CLA 3.272. Master of Horse with Caesar Dictator, 48, 47 (see MRR 2.272, 286, 295). Dio records augural opposition to more than a six-month term as Mag. Eq. (42.21.1- 2** cf. 45.27.5, in a speech attributed to Cicero), but like Caesar as Dictator, he served full-year terms (Dio 45.28.1). Consul 44. On the bill of Antonius and Dolabella to assign land to veterans (MRR 2.317), refer also to Cic. Fam. 11.2.3** Phil. 5.7 and 9** Dio 45.9.1. He is mentioned, probably as a IIIvir r. p. c., in an inscription of Ephesus which refers to honors for the deified Caesar (Forsch. Ephesus 4.3.208f., no. 4?AEpig. 1952, no. 216).[19x]
"MÅnzer (RE no. 7) brings together three notices that name a C. Herennius (cf. also MRR 2.80, 95, and 99). The first names a tribune of the plebs who vetoed ex composito a consular bill of Sulla de reditu eius (sc. Ch. Pompei), dated to 80 in MRR 2.80 on the basis of Maurenbrecher's interpretation of Sall. Hist. 2.21 M (from Gellius NA 10.20.10) that the bill referred to the recall of the young Pompey from his command in Africa (MRR 2.70, 77** see below on Pompeius no. 31). Badian, noting especially Sulla's limitation of the tribunicial right of veto, refers the phrase to Sulla's first consulship in 88, and to a proposal for the return of Pompeius Strabo (49) (Hermes 83, 1955, 109-112** 89, 1961, 254-256** see Keaveney, Sulla 74-75). This  removes a difficulty in dating young Pompey's return from Africa and his first triumph to 81. The second notice refers to a C. Herennius who served as a legate under Sertorius in Spain, and died in battle with Pompey near Valentia in Spain in 76 or 75 (Liv. 91, fr. 22W** Plut. Pomp. 18.3** Sall. Hist. 2.98.6M** cf. Sall. Hist. 2.54M). The third notice refers to a *C. Herennius, senator, named by Cicero in Verr. 1.39, who was condemned, along with C. Popillius (3) for peculatus and a M. Atilius Bulbus, ,who was condemned de maiestate, all three of whom had accepted bribes ob rem iudicandam. Cicero next mentions senators who during the urban praetorship of Verres had condemned a defendant incognita causa, and a juror, unnamed, who had accepted funds from both  defendant and prosecutor. Syme, identifying these with the ones named before, distinguishes the juror, C. Herennius, as one of the corrupt senators of 74, from both the tribune of the plebs of 88 (or 80) and the officer of Sertorius who died in battle against Pompey in 76 or 75 (Historia 4, 1955, 63-RP 1.282). Shackleton Bailey now holds that Cicero refers to two groups of senators, and that the unnamed juror mentioned above was ""surely Staienus"" (Very. 2.2.79** see MÅnzer, RE 3A, 2433-2436** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 101-102, , and Onom. ** cf. Studies 44). Accordingly, C. Herennius and C. Popillius may possibly have committed their crimes and have been condemned before 74, and it becomes possible to identify C. Herennius, the senatorial juror, with the tribune of the plebs, and perhaps also, although Cicero makes no mention of his fate, with the officer who died  in 76 or 75."
"Plebeian Consul? In the listing of the consuls up to 366 in MRR, vol. I, the Roman tradition as stated in Livy 6.42.9 (ut L. Sextius primus de plebe consul factus) is the basis for describing all the consuls up to that date as patrician. The considerable number of gentilicia which appear in the Fasti of consuls of the early fifth century and are known in later times to be exclusively plebeian, such as Cassius, Cominius, Iunius, Tullius, and Sempronius, is inconsistent with that tradition, and supports strongly the view that the patricians in spite of ready access to priesthoods and magistracies were not in complete and exclusive control. That these consuls were plebeians was accepted by Fraccaro (La storia romana arcaica 10-14?Opuscula 1-23) and is noted several times in Ogilvie's Commentary on Livy, Books 1-5 (e.g., p. 275 on 2.16.6, 232 on 1.60.4, and 277-278 on 2.17.1 on Sp. Cassius himself). A discussion of this problem cannot be undertaken here. The conclusions depend very largely on conceptions we may have formed of the origin and development of both patricians and plebeians in archaic Roman society under the kings and in the early years of the Republic. The explanation that these consuls were members of patrician branches of their gentes which died out while plebeian branches continued on is unsatisfactory because, as Momigliano remarks (RS1 79, 1967, 306-307), they were invented simply to harmonize with the tradition. He suggests, as a hypothesis, that these few non-patrician consuls were drawn from the conscripti, the additional senators described in the phrase qui patres quique conscripti (Liv. 2.1.11), who were originally neither patrician nor plebeian but were soon assimilated to the plebeian order as it formed (RS179, 1967, 197-312-Quarto Contributo 443-454** ""Osservazioni"" in Entretiens 13, 1966, 199-221, esp. 20811.). For a full discussion and survey of the various views, see J.-C. Richard, Les origines de la plebe romaine, esp. 519-540. Momigliano's hypothesis has the merit, in its distinction between conscripti and plebeians, of preserving in form at least the truth of the statement in Livy 6.42.9. On Cassius himself, see now R. M. Ogilvie, Comm. Liv. 337-345.[52x]"
 At some time after Marius? military service under Scipio at Numantia (MRR 1.492, note 3), he was defeated when a candidate for municipal office in Arpinum (Val. Max. 6.9.14** Plut. Mar. 3.2). His political career began with election to the military tribunate (Sall. Iug. 63.4** Plut. Reg. Et Imp. Apothegm. 202B), perhaps as early as 129, as Badian suggests (Gnomon 33, 1961, 496** Durham Univ. Jour. 36, 1964, 144** cf. Gabba, ANRW 1.1.270), when he could have served in Asia under M?. Aquillius, whose son was his colleague as consul in 101, but in any case by ca. 124, as Carney suggests (Biog. Marius 16-17), when, he could have served under a Metellan patron (MRR 1.513) and still have time for a quaestorship and a defeat for the tribunate of the plebs before being elected for 119 (Val. Max. 6.9.14). Cf. also J. Suolahti, Junior Officers 373. His quaestorship should be dated with Carney (loc. Cit.) to 123 or 122, in any case not later than 121. 1 wish to thank M. Maurice Fievez for drawing my attention to my omission of the  junior appointments in the original volumes and for his comments. He accepts 122 or 123 for the military tribunate and 121 for the quaestorship. See Suolahti, Junior Officers 312, 405. Praetor 115. He may have gone to Hisp. Ult. With proconsular imperium, and remained until Piso came to succeed him in 113 (Sumner, Orators  72** cf. MRR 1.532, 534, 535, note 3), thus excluding from the Spanish record M. Iunius Silanus (169), Cos. 109, whose date as praetor and whose province remain uncertain (cf. MRR 1.535, 538). Libera Legatio to Asia. I did not state in Historia 2, 1953, 210-211 that Marius met the Battaces on his visit to Rome in 102 (cf. Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 496). My point was simply that the special assurances of victory which came through him from the Magna Mater at that time provided a suitable official reason for Marius? trip to Asia, probably in 98.   He may possibly have gone to Asia and returned in time to appear at the trial of M?. Aquillius, which may then be dated to 97-96. On his activity and purposes in Asia Minor, see now T. J. Luce, Historia 19, 1970, 161-191, esp. 161-168** and M. Sordi, RIL 107, 1972, 30-37.[139x]
 Quaestor, more probably in 91 than 90 (Plut. Sert. 4.1), since Plutarch has him elected promptly after his return from Spain and also when the Marsic war was breaking out (#). He was assigned to Cisalpine Gaul, where he levied troops, procured arms, and continued active as a proquaestor (Plut. 4.1-2** cf. Sall. Hist. 1.88M). See Sumner, Orators 107-108** Spann, Sertorius 20-24. Rejected for the tribunate of the plebs of 88 or 87 through Sulla's opposition (Plut. Sert. 4.2** discussion in Spann, 24-30), preferably in 89 for 88, as his defeat appears to precede Sulla's march on Rome in 88 (Plut. loc. cit.** Spann, 24ff.** Ch. F. Konrad, Sertorius 7-12, 204, note 18). No ancient text mentions his praetorship, but the regular assignment of Hisp. Cit. to his command (App. BC 1.86, cf. 108** Ib. 101) at a time much #) earlier than his departure to Spain late in 83 strongly implies that he had held it. Schulten's date in 87 seems to be a slip (Sertorius 38), but Sertorius may  well have reached the legal age by 86, and have been praetor in 85 or 84, a date consistent with his activity in Italy (Spann, op. cit.). It seems better, rather than accept an intervening loss of imperium before he went to Spain, to assume that he kept his imperium as procos. (Spann, 37-51** Konrad, 15-26). He may have received command over both Spanish provinces as Annius Luscus did in 81 against him (MRR 2.77** see Badian, Studies 96, 104, note 164-165). Procos. in Spain. See MRR 2.90, and annually to 72 for sources. On his campaigns, see above, on Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius (98), and Cn. Pompeius Magnus (31). Spann places the siege of Contrebia (Liv. 91, fr. 22) in the autumn of 77. If his assassination has been correctly re-dated to 73, the notice regarding it in MRR 2.118 under 72 should be transferred to 73, MRR 2.112, with the addition of references to Strabo 3.4.10, 161C** Amm. Marc. 26.9.9, and with a special reference to App. Mith. 72. On the discovery that the site of Contrebia was at Botorrita, see A. Balil, Epigraphica 42, 1980, 199-202** and now J. S. Richardson, JRS 73, 1983, 33-41.
 In MRR 2.439, and Index, 560, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.300-301, no. 285, 116 or 115 B.C. Crawford notes the difficulty, due to difference in ages, in placing the consul of 96 with M. Silan(us) and Q. Curt(ius) in these years. Special commission to found the colony of Narbo. See MRR 2.528. He was probably a IIvir with the young orator L. Licinius Crassus in 118 (Vell. 1.15** 2.7). On the disputes regarding the date, see especially Sumner, Orators 94- 96, and the works cited there. These deal with both the plan and proposal to found the colony (cf. the milestone of Treilles, ILLRP 460a) by or before 118, and Crassus' dissuasio of a rogatio to annul the foundation (Cic. Cluent. 140** De Or. 2.223** Brut. 160). Tribune of the plebs. In 104, according to Asconius (80C** emendation of the impossible dating, before the trial of Cornelius in 65, ante II et XLII annos C. Mario II C. Fimbria coss. to II de XLII still confuses 104 and 103), but according to Velleius (2.15.3) he carried his law to establish election of priests by a popular assembly of seventeen tribes in Marius' third consulship (103). Against Niccolini (FTP 191), who favors 104 as the date of his tribunate, Sumner proposes a probable division of Domitius' activities between 104 and 103, with Domitius in office from December 10, 104, and the passage of his law, the prosecution of Scaurus, his own election as pontifex and also separately as pontifex maximus, all in 103 (Orators 97-100). This order assumes an otherwise unattested priestly vacancy in 103. It also assumes that his quarrels were with the colleges of both pontiffs and augurs, and not with only one which has then been confused in our sources. See above, on M. Aemilius Scaurus (140), Cos. 115. Censor, 92. See MRR 2.17. As Gaius is not a Domitian praenomen, the C. Domitius (Diod. 37.13) who peacefully turned back Poppaedius the Marsic leader and his following is probably this Gnaeus. See Sherwin-White, Roman Citizenship 140, note 3.[82x]
The cognomen Vento, given in Plutarch (Sert. 15) should be corrected to Veiento (see CIL 6.38700, and MÅnzer, RE). Refer also to Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 135** and Badian, Studies 86. His command in Sicily followed that of Norbanus, but 82 is the latest possible date. In MRR 2.87, I mistakenly stated that when in 82 Perperna fled from Pompey in Sicily he went directly to Sertorius in Spain, and at 2.91, I correctly recorded his passage from Sardinia to Sertorius in Spain in 77 after the defeat and death of Lepidus. The inconsistency has been noted by Badian (Foreign Clientelae 210, note 3) and Keaveney (AC 51, 1982, 126- 127). Between 82 and 77 he apparently spent some time both in Liguria (Oros. 5.24.16) and Sardinia, which was Marian until it was recaptured for Sulla by Philippus (Liv. Per. 86** cf. MRR 2.67 and 72, 82 B.C.). It may well have been his fleet that assisted Lepidus in defeat to pass over to Sardinia and himself and his forces to go to Spain after Lepidus? death (A. Keaveney, loc. Cit.** cf. Criniti, ?M. Aemilius Q. f. M. n. Lepidus,? Mem. Ist. Lombardo (Lett.) 30, 1969, 443-446). Leg., lieut., under Sertorius. If the battle of Lauro is rightly dated to the autumn of 77 (see Cn. Pompeius Magnus [31], below), his acceptance of Sertorius as superior in command should be placed in that year, otherwise it should be placed in 76 (see MRR 2.95, under 76, for sources). It should not be claimed that he failed to defend the line of the Ebro, as his commission in the spring of 76 (if Liv. 91, frag. 22W is rightly dated to the winter of 77/76, not the following one) was to defend the Ilercavones and the ora maritima. Could his capture of Cales in Callaecia, dated to 74 in MRR 2.105, be dated in 72/71 or 73/72 instead (Sall. Hist. 43-44M) and put with fragments 84-87M in his final period after the death of Sertorius, when Pompey pursued him to the far west of Spain? On Sall. Hist. 44M, see Strabo 3.3.4 and RE on the river Lethe in northwestern Spain.[155x]
In Athenaeum 34, 1956, 104-123, Badian had argued strongly in favor of 94, the year after his consulate, rather than 97, the year after his praetorship, for his proconsulate in Asia, pointing out (with MÅnzer) how unlikely it is that an elderly consular, Rutilius, would serve as legatus under a praetorian governor. He holds that Mucius was a special consular appointment to meet a crisis in the province, that the situation in Rome was favorable to prompt action to try Rutilius (condemned in 92) upon his return, and that a date in 94 makes the pattern of political development during the decade more intelligible. These are important points. Yet the uses of the phrase deponere provinciam (Ascon. 15C** cf. Cic. Phil. 11.23) seem to favor the view that Mucius did renounce a province, and the question remains whether the text of Asconius, with the pluperfect deposuerat, as a whole refers primarily to his consulship or may refer back several years to his praetorship. He could have renounced his province early in his year as consul and have vetoed Crassus? claim to a triumph toward the end. Governors of Asia in this period were regularly praetorian. The crisis in the East had been developing and was known since 104 (Diod. 36.3, referring to Bithynia), and trials, like that of Norbanus, were sometimes deferred for several years after the alleged offenses until political conditions were ripe. The rank of Rutilius is a good point, though conceivably the claims of friendship and long association may have overridden those of rank. On balance, it appears from Asconius 15C most probable that it was earlier in his year as consul that Scaevola had renounced his province before he vetoed his colleague?s claim to a triumph. If so, he was governor of Asia as a praetorian province in 98 or 97 (MRR 2.7** Nicolet, Ordre equestre 545-546** Sumner, GRBS 19, 1978, 147** and also in favor of 98 or 97, B. A. Marshall, Athenaeum 54, 1976, 117-130).[145x]
"IIvir coloniae deducendae, with Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (21), Cos. 96, for the founding of Narbo (see MRR 1.528). Discussion of the date of the founding and of the related coinage has continued actively. H. B. Mattingly (Hommages A. Grenier 3.1159ff.) holds that Cicero's account of the career of Licinius Crassus implies a date for the founding after 114, a conclusion refuted by B. Levick (CQ 21, 1971, 170-179), and Sumner (Orators 94-97), who both return to 118. For the coinage he suggests ca. 110 (later 114, NC 1969, 95-105), but Crawford places the founding and the coinage both in 118 (RRC 1.298-299, no. 282, with argument in 1.71-73). See Badian, Mel. Piganiol 903-904, and Roman Imperialism? 24, 98, note 2, for a date ca. 115** Gruen, RPCC 137, note 4, for one between 113 and 107** and note the effective survey and criticism by Sumner, loc. cit. Quaestor. In MRR 1.546, add that he served in Asia (Cic. De Or. 3.75), and that the date may be 111 or 110 or both (Sumner, Orators 96-97). Consul 95, with Q. Mucius Scaevola (22). In MRR 2.11 the Lex Licinia Mucia was incorrectly described as a law ""to send Italians resident in Rome back to their own towns."" The phrase describing it in Cic. Corn. fr. 10, de civibus redigendis, is given more fully in Ascon. 67-68C as ut in suae quisque civitatis ius redigeretur. It means that they, i.e., the Italici who were acting as if they were Roman citizens, should each be reduced to the legal status of their own towns. Cf. also, Cic. Off. 3.47, which strongly implies that it was not an act of expulsion. See Badian, Historia 18, 1969, 490** Dial. di Archeol. 4-5, 1970-71, 406-407 (on the unrest aroused by the quaestio which followed)** and, against the statement in Schol. Bob. 129St, in JRS 63, 1973, 127-128. His province after his consulship may have been both Gallia Cisalpina and Transalpina (Badian, Studies 92, and 103, note 146). See, however, Ascon. 15C, and below, on Q. Mucius Scaevola."
The date of these aedileships remains in dispute. Against the date in 54 usually accepted (see MRR 2.223), L. R. Taylor, noting the difficulty of explaining their prosecution under the Lex Licinia de sodaliciis in 54 if that was the year of their office, saw that the conditions of election in 55 after an interregnum made it quite possible for these tribunes of the plebs in 56, leaving that office on December 10, to qualify as candidates for the aedileship of 55** and, as Cicero (Planc. 49) shows, Pompey, auctor, not lator, of that law, was in charge of that election (Athenaeum 42, 1964, 12-28** see also J. Linderski, Studi E. Volterra 2.284-302). There is no definite proof that Aemilius Paullus (81) and Nonius (50) were curule aediles at that time (MRR 2.216, and see above, on Nonius Sufenas [52]). Against this dating, Sumner (Phoenix 25, 1971, 249, note 12) presents the following considerations, while admitting that 55 is a possibility: he finds no implication in Planc. 49 that the consul who presided over the comitia superiora also presided over the final election** Pompey could have held the elections for 54, and as there still were elections in prospect in mid-November 55 (Att. 4.13.1), the passage in Planc. 49 may mean that the elections for aediles were delayed into 54** if Plancius had been aedile in 55, why did Cicero  in 54 make no reference to his achievement in office? And the legal difficulty of a trial in the year of office is met if the proposal, rejected in 55, of a period of 60 days between election and entrance into office, had been accepted for 54. There is no evidence that there was such a period, and the aedilician coinage of Plautius with its reference to the Megalesian games in April is rather against it, while the date of the trial of Plancius, in August near the time of the Roman games, is still more so. On balance, 55 seems the more probable year.
"See MRR 1.452-453. Authors of two distinct but closely related laws, the Leges Aelia et Fufia. G. V. Sumner has clarified the content and purpose of these laws, the former confirming the validity of such religious procedures as the obnuntiatio in obstructing or preventing the passage of unwelcome legislation in the assemblies, and the latter in regulating the rights and times for voting on laws, the whole intended to limit tribunicial activity. As to their date, Sumner takes Cicero's phrase centum prope annos (Pis. 10) to be rhetorical exaggeration, and, turning to the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus as a time when the need to curb tribunicios furores ( Vat. 18) was greatest, finds in Q. Aelius Tubero (155), triumvir (rerum capitalium, not tribune as in MRR 1.502), and perhaps tribune ca. 132, a suitable author for the Lex Aelia, and in the grandfather of Q.  Fufius Calenus (10), Pr. 59, Cos. 47, a suitable possibility for the Lex Fufia (AJPh 84, 1963, 337358). In this Sumner rejects the probable implication of Cic. Vat. 23 that these laws were at least pre-Gracchan (sanctissimas leges, Aeliam et Fufiam dico, quae in Gracchorum ferocitate . . . vixerunt) and the evidence of considerable tribunicial obstruction of magistrates in the period of the Spanish wars, even to the extreme of throwing consuls into prison, and interference with the levy from about 150 on (L. R. Taylor, JRS 52, 1962, 19-27, esp. 22-24** cf. T. Frank, CAH 8.367). L. R. Taylor also conjectured that these laws, ""directed mainly against tribunicios furores,"" may have been introduced by Aelius and Fufius as praetors (op. cit. 23). For other discussions, see Gruen, AJPh 84, 1963, 337-358, and LGRR 255** Astin, Latomus 25, 1964, 421-445. In spite of many uncertainties, Cicero's centum prope annos and the implication that the laws were pre-Gracchan favor a date toward the middle of the second century.[3x]"

 In JRS 45, 1955, 91-96, T. A. Dorey argues that the reading  Minucius in Plut. Marc. 5.4, referring to the dictator who was compelled to abdicate because of the squeaking of a rodent when he was appointing C. Flaminius his master of horse, is correct and that he was not Fabius Maximus as Val. Max. has it (1.1.5). (So also J. Bleicken, Volkstribunat 30.) He would refer to this dictatorship the inscription with the title Dictator (CIL 1?.2.607?ILS 11-ILLRP 118). Fabius, who had held a dictatorship before 217, would then have been appointed in Minucius? place. The inscription then would not necessarily refer to the co-dictatorship of 217 (MRR 1.243). The date of this dictatorship remains uncertain but must be after 222 and before 218. Dorey suggests that it was before 220 (MRR 1.235), when the first pair of consuls had failed to take office. Note however the difficulties that Badian found in Dorey?s reconstruction (Gnomon 33, 1961, 497), especially the vow to Hercules made while dictator (ILS 11), and the improbability that the augurs who secured the supersession of Minucius by Fabius then proceeded to secure the supersession by his (and their) opponents  of the consuls whose election Fabius had achieved. See also Lippold, Consules 144, note 49. Badian agrees that Livy may be correct in preferring a measure de aequando magistri equitum et dictatoris iure, and that Minucius used it, as in ILS 11, to justify the same titles. See also Walbank, 1.243, Comm. On Polyb. 3.103.1-5, and his statement that there were two simultaneous dictators. Addendum. J. Jahn, Interregnum and Wahldiktatur 109- 115, agrees on the two dictatorships, one of Minucius with Flaminius as master of horse, which was vitiated by the squeaking of a sorex, and a second of a Q. Fabius Maximus with an unknown master of horse, and dates both to either 220 or 219.[143x]
"See MRR 1.571, 573, note 2. Last (CAH 9.162f.) and[195x] Balsdon (PBSR 14, 1938, 107 and 113) pointed out that Glaucia may have been a tribune either in 104 or in 101, in each case in a year preceding a tribunate of Saturninus. The relevant passage of Appian (BC 1.28) is confused but the association he makes with the murder of Nunnius and the second tribunate of Saturninus favors a date in 101. Appian (loc. cit.) appears to say that Glaucia presided as praetor over the election of tribunes, a function which only a tribune could have performed. (On possible praetorian ""oversight,"" see Mommsen, StR 1?.141, 518** 2?.278.) Perhaps the situation was that Saturninus looked to be tribune in a year when Glaucia was praetor, and that it was as a tribune in 101 Glaucia presided over the election of tribunes for 100, before he was himself elected a praetor for that year. Tibiletti considers the Latin Lex Tabulae Bantinae to be probably a portion of the Lex Servilia Glauciae, but favors a date early in 100 (Athenaeum 31, 1953, 1-100, esp. 66-73, 83-85). Since Glaucia was a senator at the time of the census of 102-101 in a period when the quaestorship did not as yet provide automatic entrance to the Senate (Mommsen, StR 3.862f.), he is inclined to date Glaucia's tribunate before the previous censorship in 108-107 (an impossible date for a law which must be later than the Lex Servilia Caepionis of 106), and to admit the possibility that the confused notice in Appian (BC 1.28) may refer to a second tribunate rather than a praetorship in 101. But E. Gabba is inclined to accept the view that Glaucia entered the Senate in virtue of having held the quaestorship before 108 (Athenaeum 33, 1955, 218ff.** and Comm. on App. BC 1.28), and held the tribunicial elections for 101, before his own election as praetor for 100."
To the evidence regarding the date of Cato's birth, add Cic. Fam. 16.22.1, de quadrimo Catone. Quaestor 64? According to the anecdote in Plut. Cat. Min. 16.3-6, Cato was in office as quaestor while C. Lutatius Catulus was still censor (see 65, Censors). Catulus and his colleague Crassus quarrelled soon after taking office, according to Plutarch (Crass. 13.1) about a proposal to annex Egypt, according to Dio (37.9.3) about admitting the Transpadanes to full citizenship, and resigned their office without accomplishing any of their other duties. If they were elected early in the year this evidence would favor a date in 65 rather than 64 for Cato's quaestorship. We do not know with certainty the time of year when censors were elected, although spring seems probable (Mommsen, StR 2.353), nor yet how long the deadlock between the censors lasted before they abdicated. They may well have been in office when Cato (if 64 is the correct date for the quaestorship) entered office on December 5, 65 ? and the fact that the anecdote refers to the beginning of Cato's quaestorship supports the later date - but resigned either before the end of the year or in time for other censors, whose efforts were equally futile, to be elected in the spring or summer of 64 (see MRR 2.165, note 5). See L. Renders, AC 8, 1939, 111-125. (RS, CP) Annexing of Cyprus, 58. His title of authority, as Balsdon has shown (JRS 52, 1962, 134-135** cf. Badian, JRS 55, 1965, 110-113), when he was sent under the law of Clodius to annex Cyprus was pro quaestore pro praetore. Badian rightly holds that his mandate was simply annexation of the island and seizure of the royal property, not the organization of Cyprus as a province. Propraetor with Metellus Scipio in Africa, 47-46. In MRR 2.289, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.473, no. 462, 47-46 B.C.[170x]
See MRR 1.395 and 397, note 1. The praetorship of Manlius Vulso and of all the prae tors not otherwise attested between the passage of the Lex Villia Annalis in 180 and the legislation of Sulla is inferred from their attainment o the consulship. A. Afzelius (C & M 8, 1946, 261-278) and F. de Martino (Storia d. cost. Rom. 2.362ff.) held that this Lex, as Livy remark** (40.44.1), merely set an age  limit for each magistracy, but did not prescribe an order or a biennium between the curule ones. This view, is correct, weakens the presumption that all who held the consulship between 180 and 81 had held the praetorship, unless specifically exempted by special legislation, like Scipio Aemilianus (335), Cos. 147 even though, as Afzelius agrees, Roman custom and legally established age limits would go far toward creating the situation I have assumed. He uses the case of A. Manlius Vulso, whose name does not appear on the list of praetors, to support his view. Note however that in 189 the political conditions when a praetor died in office and a brother and a close family friend were consuls might well have aided an election as suffec praetor then. Moreover, if the notice in Plutarch that all twelve of the rivals of Aemilius Paullus for the curule aedileship of 193 attained higher office later (Aem. Paull. 3.1) is not a gross exaggeration, Manlius, who must have been one of them in a  patrician year, would have been ready for a praetorship in 189. The abortive candidacy of Iulius Caesar Strabo for the consulship of 87 is termed illegal by Asconius (and by Cicero) because he had not been praetor (see  MRR 2.41). Astin?s review of the question (Lex Annalis before Sulla) shows that the biennium between curule magistracies seems mandatory, and that the praetorship was a necessary qualification for the consulship.
"T. J. Cadoux believes that the evidence in our sources points to the existence of three rather than two Cascas, the two members of the conspiracy, and C. Casca, Tr. pl. 44, who announced his innocence by claiming that the name Casca was all that he had in common with the conspirator (Dio 44.52). Cadoux's note reads as follows: I feel that the evidence points to three Cascas: (1) the brother of Publius who shared in Caesar's murder (praenomen nowhere stated)** (2) C. Casca, Tr. pl. 44, who announced his innocence of the murder** (3) P. Casca Longus, Tr. pl. 43, the prominent conspirator. MÅnzer (see 53) and you unite the first two: but it was notorious that the two Cascas, brothers, were involved in the murder, and therefore only a third could have established his innocence. This naturally gave rise to confusions: thus Appian (BC 2.113) wrongly applies the praenomen Gaius to his one Casca, probably intending the more prominent Publius (it is of course possible that his brother was in fact also a Gaius, which would aid the confusion)** and Dio, who knows of only one Casca among the murderers, Publius, wrongly makes him tribune of the plebs in 44 (44.52.2) as well as in 43 (46.49.1). Suetonius' words ""alter a Cascis"" (Iul. 82) refer to the two guilty brothers and by no means exclude a third contemporary Casca** Eutropius is simply naming the four most prominent murderers. The claim that the tribune of 44 had only the name Casca in common with the conspirators provides an important support for the distinction, and suggests that his gentilicium may not have been Servilius. Shackleton Bailey agrees that the evidence is in favor of the existence of three Cascas (Onom.). The entries in the index would then be: (Servilius) Casca (52, cf. 53), brother of the conspirator, probably senator in 44."
On his procedure and motives in the case of C. Manilius, accused of res repetundae, and on his speech Pro (or De) Manilio, see J. T. Ramsey, Phoenix 34, 1980, 323-336, and discussions cited there. Augur, 53 or 52. The date, whether in 53 or 52, of Cicero's election to the augurate remains uncertain (see MRR 2.233). We know it was before Curio's return from Asia (late 53 or early in 52) and before Antony's departure for Gaul in 52. If sure and certain news of the death of Crassus at Carrhae (June 9, 53) reached Rome in time for the priestly nominations and elections between the consular elections and the praetorian ones for 53, he might have been elected in or by August 53 (see MRR 2.227228, on the consular elections, and Cic. Ad Brut. 1.5.3, on the priestly elections). But otherwise, as Linderski has pointed out, his election must be later than the election of Pompey as sole consul in 52 (V a. d. Kal. Mart. in the intercalary  month in 52) and early in March 52, when we know the election of quite minor magistrates had been held (Ascon. 37C, on the IIIviri Capitales). See J. Linderski, HSPh 76, 1972, 190200** and cf. now Shackleton Bailey, Philologus 126, 1982, 213: commenting on Cic. Phil. 2.3-4, he finds in Cicero's letters to Curio (Fam. 2.1-6, esp. 2.6) an indication that Curio had very probably returned promptly from Asia to Rome, and arrived by autumn of 53. Proconsul 49. See MRR 2.264. Cicero was assigned a command to recruit troops and guard the region of Capua but did not assume it (Att. 8.1113.5** 8.12.2), and had also the lesser command of the ora maritima (Att. 7.14.3** 8.1113.1** cf. 7.11.5** Fam. 16.2.5** see Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4, Appendix II, 438-440** J. Linderski, Gnomon 52, 1980, 784 [rev. of M. Wistrand, Cicero Imperator]).
In an important treatise (Athenaeum 31, 1953, 1-100), G. Tibiletti has shown that the repetition of the article in the formula in which the Rubrian and the Acilian laws are mentioned in the treaty between Rome and Astypalaea (IG 12.3.173 IGRP 4.1028) implies that they were two separate laws and may have separate dates. With this disappears the chief evidence for dating the tribunate of Acilius in the same year with that of Rubrius (2, cf. 9), whose bill created the colony of Carthage, and also one support for the claim that the law preserved in part on the Tabula Bembina is in fact the Lex Acilia de repetundis. Tibiletti holds that the law preserved on the Tabula is the Lex Sempronia itself, and that the Lex Acilia was carried later, superseding it, but must be dated before the use of the tablet for the text of the Lex Agraria of 111. The tribunate (or perhaps the praetorship) of M'. Acilius Glabrio should be dated between 121 and 111, and the law mentioned in the treaty with Astypalaea may be referred to the same time. On the other hand, Badian uses the apparent  order of the Gracchan proposals, Cicero's mention of the Lex Acilia in Verr. 1.51, and the stemma of the Acilii Glabriones to hold that the law preserved on the Tabula Bembina was the Lex Acilia. He accepts the division between the Lex Rubria and the Lex Acilia, with the tribunate of Rubrius in 123 and that of Acilius in 122  (AJPh 75, 1954, 374-384), and (in AJPh 96, 1975, 67-75) interprets the audacissimi referred to in Cic. Verr. 1.51 as the persons the praetor Glabrio must oppose, keeping in mind his father and his father's law. It remains an important part of the legislative program of C. Gracchus. See also C.? Rubrius (2, cf. 9), Q. Servilius Caepio (49), and C. Servilius Glaucia (65).
"On his coinage, see Crawford, RRC 1.356-357, no. 345, who dates it to 88 and attributes it, not to the consul of 56 as in MRR 2.437, but to Lentulus Clodianus (216), Cos. 72 (see above). See also Wiseman, NC 1964, 156. He attributes the coins inscribed Lent(ulus) Cur(ator) Den(ariorum) Fl(andorum) Q. to the future consul of 56 (RRC 1.407, no. 393, 76- 75 B.C.** see MRR 2.103), when he was quaestor, perhaps in Spain. Tr. pl. 68, and Leg., lieut. 67. Syme (JRS 53, 1963, 56-60-RP 2.559-563) and Sumner (Orators 125-126, 133-134) identify the Cn. Cornelius (24), Tr. pl. 68 (see MRR 2.138** ILLRP 465a), with the future consul of 56, and with the Cn. Lentulus (Cic. Leg. Man. 58) who was a legatus the year after his tribunate, as Marcellinus was in fact legatus pro praetore with Pompey in 67 (MRR 2.148). See also Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 122-123. In the war against the pirates he had charge of the  coast of Cyrene. For inscriptions attesting his authority there and his services to the cities of Cyrene, see J. M. Reynolds, JRS 52, 1962, 97-103. Identification of the tr. pl. of 68 with the cos. of 56 demands that the latter should be considered a plebeian. The adoption of Dolabella by a Lentulus in order to make him eligible for the tribunate of 47 shows that there were plebeian Lentuli (Shackleton Bailey, Studies 29-32). His election as VIIvir Epulo (Cic. Har. Resp. 21, 56 B.C.** MRR 2.214) may also imply that he was plebeian (Willems, Senat 1.444** Mommsen, RF 1.90-91** but cf. Shackleton Bailey, AJPh 96, 1975, 333). Procos. in Syria, 59. See MRR 2.190. Crawford attributes to him a gold stater, minted at Antioch and inscribed Cn. Lentul (RRC 1.544-545, no. 549). Cos. 56.

"The unknown honorand had been an envoy not only to these officials but to many cities and to the future Seleucus VI, before he became king in 95 (or else not recognizing him, Sumner). If the list is in chronological order these almost unknown officials must date from the late second or early first century (see MRR 2.462, 463, and 465** Magie, RRAM 1579), but if they were arranged on some other principle, such as rank, they may be dated later (see C. P. Jones, Chiron 4, 1974, 203, and note 133). This would make it possible to identify L. Piso with the praetor of 74 (MRR 2.102), and Hypsaeus perhaps with a legate of Sulla (2.465), and Silanus quaestor with the future praetor of 77 and proconsul of Asia in 76 (2.88, 94), but if they are governors of Asia, as Sumner holds, there is no place for them in the Asian Fasti of the 70s and 80s. Moreover, as Shackleton Bailey has shown, # is a strange expression for ""Murena's quaestor."" See Wiseman, LCM 1, 1976, 2, who, following Magie, RRAM 1126, note 43, reads # as in the inscription and interprets it as an adoptive cognomen** cf. Shackleton Bailey, Studies 118-119, who confuses the text on the stone and the emendation** Sumner, GRBS 19, 1978, 147-153. See also M. H. Crawford, in LCM 7, 1982, 124, who notes Wosnik's reading #, but prefers with Wiseman (above) to consider # as an adoptive cognomen and read # as on the stone. See now A. Keaveney, Klio 66, 1984, 120-121, for the attractive suggestion that Silanus Murena was quaestor with C. Cassius (10), proconsul in Asia in 89 (MRR 2.34 and 38, note 6), and himself the proconsul of 76. But see Addendum, p. 27, above.[114x]"
There were two Lucceii who were contemporaries in this period. Both appear in Cicero's letters, one with the filiation Q. f. (6) and the other with the filiation M. f. (5). The latter was an active business man, interested in provincial affairs, and the former was the historian (see Cic. Fam. 5.12). W. C. McDermott (Hermes 97, 196, 233-246) has assigned the various references to each and concludes that M. f. was the candidate for the consulship of 59 (Cic. Att. 1.17.11** 2.19), while Q. f., after his praetorship in 67, refused appointment to be governor of Sardinia (MRR 2.143) and made no attempt at the consulship. In this scheme there is, as McDermott himself recognized, a clear contradiction between his view and the statement of Asconius (910 that L. Lucceius paratus eruditusque, who must be the historian, was the one qui consulatum postea quoque petivit, an important point, in spite of the list of known errors in Asconius collected by McDermott (op. cit. 242). See Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.318-319** on Fam. 5.12. Praetor, uncertain date. On the basis of Hîlzl's emendation of # to #, this praetorship of uncertain date is generally attributed to Lucceius, the consular candidate. If J. M. David and M. Dondin are right in returning to the name of Lucullus, the evidence for Lucceius? praetorship disappears, whether he was M. f. or Q. f. See above on L. Licinius Lucullus (104). The latest date possible under the Leges Annales for the praetorship of the consular candidate of 60 is 62 (Cic. Att. 1.17.11), a year in which the name of the occupant of one of the eight places remains unknown (MRR 2.173). See J. M. David and M. Dondin, MEFR 92, 1980, 199-213** and also above, on M?. Acilius Glabrio (38).
Delete this entry both in MRR 2.484, and in the Index, 580, since Cicero in Mur. 73 refers to another, unnamed person (RS, CP). Procos. 64, in Transalpine Gaul. See MRR 2.163. Against W. A. Allen, Jr., who uses Sall. Cat. 42.3 as evidence that Murena held the Cisalpine province too (CPh 48, 1953, 176-177) Badian has shown that he held only Transalpina and that in Sallust the word citeriore is a mistake and should be emended to ulteriore (Mel. Piganiol 915-918). See above, on C. Calpurnius Piso (63), Cos. 67. Cos. 62. Badian (in Mnemai Hulley, 97-101) defends the usually obelized or emended text in Cic. Att. 1.16.13, simul cum lege alia, as correct, and explains it as a reference to a law that was carried on December 10, 62, on the same day as Lurco (see MRR 2.179) entered office as a tribune of the plebs, still in the consulship of Licinius Murena and Iunius Silanus. He suggests that this was a consular law, the Lex Iunia et Licinia (cf. Phil. 5.7-8** Leg. 3.11), and thus finds an exact date for its passage. Addendum. The phrase summum imperium in Cic. Mur. 89, taken in MRR 2.163 to indicate that Murena held an imperium pro consule in Gallia Transalpina, is in fact used by Cicero not only to describe such an imperium (cf. Verr. 1.37 [Hortensius], and Rab. Perd. 3 [consules]) but also an imperium pro praetore (cf. Verr. 2.2.14  [Verres] and 2.5.134) and that proposed for the Xviri under the Lex Agraria of Rullus (Leg. Agr. 1.9** 2.34, and 99). The phrase in Mur. 89 therefore is not proof of an imperium pro consule, but does not exclude it. From an unpublished paper by Brad Nilsson, ?The Governorship of L. Licinius Murena in 64 and 63 B.C.? (Univ. of North Carolina).[123x]
In MRR 2.23, refer: also to Cic. ND 1.61** 3.80** and cf. MRR 2.25, note 2. Praetor. Sumner suggests that he was probably elected a praetor promptly after Sulla's victory and his return to Rome (Cic. Brut. 311), so probably for 81, and then became propraetor in Spain in 80 (Orators 110** cf. MRR 2.78). C. F. Konrad in his thesis (see the Bibliography) suggests that the commander of the fleet in Spain may not have been either C. or M. Cotta but L., the youngest of the three brothers (RE no. 102, Cos. 65), but in that case his service would have been under Fufidius (see MRR 2.81). For P. O. Spann (Sertorius 76), C. Cotta was proconsul in Hisp. Ult. in 80 (Plut. Sert. 12.2** Sall. Hist. 104-105M) and Fufidius was Cotta's legatus. Aedile? The passage (Of. 2.59) in which Cicero reports the boast of L. Philippus (Cos. 91), Cotta (above), and C. Curio (Cos. .76) that they had attained omnia quae haberentur amplissima sine ullo munere is understood by both MÅnzer and Shatzman to mean that they were never aediles. Probably so, but Cicero's reference, there to the relatively modest expense of his own aedileship might cause some uncertainty. Badian remarks that all three are mentioned in the past tense, and so had died before the autumn of 44 when Cicero finished writing this book of the De Officiis (Athenaeum 48, 1970, 3-4** cf Att. 16.11). Shatzman (Athenaeum 46, 1968, 345f.) is therefore mistaken in naming L. Cotta, who was still alive in the autumn of 44 (Cic. Phil. 2. 13). It remains true however that Philippus in 86, Curio almost certainly in 61 (see on C. Scribonius Curio [10], below), and L. Cotta in 64, all reached the censorship, but C. Cotta never did.
See above, on L. Appuleius Saturninus (29). As the settlements of Marian veterans in Africa were probably made in accordance with the tribunicial legislation of Saturninus in 103 (see E. Gabba, Athenaeum 29, 1951, 12-24** Comm. on App. BC 1.28) this Caesar and Iulius Caesar Strabo may well have been Xviri a. d. a. i. in 103 and 102 (MRR 1.563, 577, 578, note 6). In his restoration of the former's Elogia (Inscr. Ital. 13.3, nos. 7 and 75a) Degrassi places the service on the agrarian commission between the praetorship and the proconsulate in Asia, and thus might suggest dates before 102 for them** so, too, that by Tenney Frank in AJPh 58, 1937, 90-93, while the one offered by Broughton (AJA 52, 1948, 323-330) allows for a later date. See Degrassi, ILLRP 394 and note. Teutsch rejected Cercina in the Elogium (no. 7) as unsuitable for settlement and in Numidian territory (Rîmische StÑdtewesen in Nordafrika 7- 27, esp. 12-13), but there had been settlement there (Liv. 33.48.3) and the known Marian settlements were on Numidian land. Note also T. D. Barnes (CR 21, 1971, 332) in favor of Mariana in Corsica. In the Elogium his service as Tr. Mil. precedes his quaestorship and both probably preceded the post on the agrarian commission. See Suolahti, Junior Officers 312, 405. Praetor, and Proconsul in Asia. See MRR 2.17, 22. Note also that he was lonoured at Samos (IGRP 4.970-Raubitschek, JRS 44, 1954, 67, no. M). References in I. Priene 111 to the terms of three stephanephoroi and to two embassies to him by the honorand indicate a span of three years in Asia, probably 92-90 (Sumner, GRBS 19, 1978, 147-149).
not Vibullius as in MRR 1.189, and 2.634. The form of his name and the title of his command vary greatly in the sources: # in Polyb. 1.7.7, # In App. Samn. 9** Diod. 22.1.2-3** and Dio, fr. 40, 7-12** D. Vibellius in Liv. 28.28.4, and Decius Vibellius in Per. 12** Iubellius, Val. Max. 2.7.15. He belonged to a prominent Campanian family. His title is tribunus militum in Livy 28.28.4 # in Diodorus and # in Appian and Dio), but praefectus in Per. 12, which seems most probably correct. From 182 on he was in command of a garrison set up by Rome in Rhegium at the request of its citizens for protection against Lucanians and other South Italian peoples. It was called a legio Campana (octava legio in Orosius 4.3.3-5), but it was an irregular company of Campanians under a Campanian leader. Like the Mamertines a few years before them in Messana, they massacred the citizens they were to protect and took over the city** they entered into friendly relations with the Mamertines, and attacked other cities, such as Croton and Caulonia, but in the end, in the aftermath of the war with Pyrrhus, they were besieged in Rhegium, captured, and severely punished by the Romans. Vibellius is said to have been blinded and committed suicide (see also Dion. Hal. 20.16). See J. Heurgon, Capoue preromaine 203-206, and The Rise of Rome 212-213** Scullard, A History of the Roman World from 753 to 146 B.C 128** Walbank, Comm. Polyb. 1.52** Cassola, I Gruppi Politici Romani nel III Secolo a. C. 171** the detailed treatment by V. La Bua, ?Regio e Decio Vibellio,? MGR 3, 1971, 63-141. Note also the doubt about the story in E. T. Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites 29, note.[219x]
"See MRR 2.263. Discussion continues of his name, identity, and rank. The L. Postumius, probably not a noble, who is mentioned with M. Favonius in Sallust (or Pseudo-Sallust) Ad Caesarem 2.9.4, is almost certainly, as Sumner and Shackleton Bailey agree, the Postumius who was assigned to Sicily early in 49 under Cato's command (Cic. Att. 7.15.2** cf. for comment Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.310). As Cato was then a praetorius, Postumius was probably only of quaestorian rank. Yet he felt himself to be a person of some importance since, when he refused to go to Sicily without Cato, he also set ""no small store by his own activity (opera) and influence (auctoritas)"" in the expected Senate meeting about Caesar's terms. He was also very probably the violent T. Postumius, non minus vehemens orator quam bellator, effrenatus et acer nimis, named in Cicero, Brutus 269, who had died in the war. If this identification is correct, the praenomen L. is probably preferable to T., which is unknown among the patrician Albini, but, as Shackleton Bailey shows, should not be wholly excluded, though very rare, from plebeian holders of the name. Sumner would identify him also with the Postumus (Postumius) who was a candidate for the praetorship of 62, and with the Monetalis C. Postumius (12). Shackleton Bailey rejects identification with L. Postumius (15), above, but, in spite of the many emendations of Cicero's speech required, would consider identifying the praetorian candidate of 63 and the monetalis of 74. See above, on C. Postumius (12)** Sumner, Orators 144-145** cf. Phoenix 25, 1971, 254, note 26** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.310** Studies 58-60.[172]"
"Leg., lieut. under Pompey in Spain 77?ca. 73 or 72, and definitely mentioned at the battle of the Sucro (Plut. Sert. 19.3** cf. Pomp. 19** Cic. Balb. 5** on the date, 76 or 75?, see below, on Pompeius [31] and Sertorius [3]). Praetor 72? He must have held a praetorship before becoming proconsul in Spain. Proconsul in Hisp. Cit., 71?-67? His capture of Calagurris Nasica only after a long and desperate siege when other communities had already surrendered to Pompey suggests that he had succeeded to the command when Pompey and Metellus had returned to Italy (Oros. 5.23.14** cf. Sall. Hist. 3.86 and 87 M** Val. Max. 7.6, ext. 3** Flor. 2.10.9** Exsuperant. 8, who credits Pompey with the capture** on their return, see Cic. Leg. Man. 30** cf. App. BC 1.119** Plut. Crass. 11.3). For his relationship with Valentia, perhaps also late in surrendering, see ILS 878-ILLRP 385. The date of his return and triumph is uncertain (Cic. Pis. 58, undated** cf. MRR 2.133, perhaps 69), and since he did not become a legatus with Pompey again until the command against Mithridates in 66, it may have been as late as 68 or 67. See Ch. F. Konrad, ""Afranius Imperator,"" Hisp. Ant. 8, 1978, 67-76. See also M. Malavolta (MGR 5, 1977, 251-303), who brings out the close parallel between his career and that of M. Pupius Piso (10), and places his triumph in 69 but admits 67 as the terminus ante quem. See Badian, Mel. Piganiol 2.913, note 4, for the suggestion that he held a Gallic province after his praetorship (ca. 70-69) and triumphed from there. See also C. Ebel, Phoenix 29, 1975, 358-373, esp. 366ff. On his novitas, see Wiseman, NM 210, no. 9.[12x]"
See above, on RE no. 10. The date of his quaestorship remains conjectural (Badian, Philologus 103, 1959, 95-96, perhaps 70 or 69, although he was eligible by 80). Tr. Pl. 67 (MRR 2.144-145). Carcopino (Mel. Glotz 1.120-122) attributed the Lex Gabinia which reserved the meetings of the Senate in February for the hearing of foreign embassies to A. Gabinius (6), tr. pl. 139, but Niccolini (FTP 256- 258) favors the tribunate of 67. So, too, do M. Griffin (JRS 63, 1973, 209-210) and Shackleton Bailey (CLF 1.300, on Fam. 1.4.1** but cf. CQF 195-196 on QF 2.11.3, with a hint that the Lex may have been passed after the Lex Papia of 61). This would bring it to his praetorship in 61 or his consulship in 58. Cicero ( Verr. 1.90, legati Milesii ... tametsi mensem Februarium expectant) indicates that in 70 February was a regular time for receiving embassies, while Fam. 1.4.1 and QF 2.1.3 show that it was reserved by law. Cf. also Att. 1.14.5 and 18.7. See Colin, FD 3.4.48. This Gabinius and his tribunate in 67 seem the most probable choices. The Lex de Piratis persequendis, Delphi, B, 17-19 (FIRA 1.122-131, esp. 124), indicates that there was a regular order for the reception of embassies, from which in this case the Rhodians were exempted (not preserved in the Cnidian text, JRS 64, 1974, 195-220, esp. 207-208). In the Lex Gabinia Ca1purnia de Delo (CIL 1?.2500) the cognomen Capito does not belong to the consul of 58 but to the first voter for the law, A. Gabinius A. f. Capito (J. and A. Linderski, ZPE 12, 1973, 247-252** see now C. Nicolet et al., Insula Sacra 45-61, esp. 53-57).[97x]
Contrary to the view expressed in MRR 1.568, and 569, note 2, and TAPhA 77, 1946, 35-40, that he was a praetor in 100 and proconsul in 101 and 100, comparison with many governors who went to Spain as praetors with an imperium pro consule (see Jashemski, Proconsular and Propraetorian Imperium, 41-50) has led me to believe that this was the nature of his command too, whether he is termed praetor as in Livy (Per. 68) or proconsul as in Cicero (De Or. 1.82) or in the epigram from Corinth (CIL 1?.2.2662-ILLRP 1342). Accordingly, his titles give no clue to the course of his actions or to the dates of his quaestors and his legates. It becomes possible, for example, to date the epigram from Corinth,  the stay of the fleet under Hirrus, and perhaps even his advance to Side all in the year 102. Note the contribution to his forces from Byzantium (Tac. Ann. 12.62.2). On Antonius in Asia Minor, see Magie, RRAM 283, 1161- 1162** Sherwin-White, JRS 66, 1976, 4-8** 67, 1977** 69-70. His triumph in 100 must be dated after the death of Saturninus, when he was still extra urbem, and before the end of the year (Cic. Rab. Perd. 21). See below, on L. Appuleius Saturninus (29). Consul 99. In MRR 2.1, refer also to CIL 11.2.2305-ILLRP 209. Legatus in the Social War? In Brutus 304 Cicero notes his absence from Rome in 90 and 89. Even though he is not on Appian's list of legates (BC 1.40-41), it is reasonable to infer that he served in the war, quite possibly, as Badian suggests, as one of L. Caesar's legati (Historia 6, 1957, 341-342-Studies 56-57).
See MRR 2.433, 539, with Cn. Fulvius and M. Calidius. Crawford's dating to 117 or 116 (RRC 1.300, no. 284) makes him a more probable candidate than Metellus Nepos (95), Cos. 98. Praetor by 112, and promag. afterwards. See MRR 1.538, 539, note 3, 541 and 551. Against note 3, Badian would date the trial for res repetundae after his consular command in Africa in 107 or 106 for the reason that no praetorius could so command the juror's respect, but Cicero's reference to equestrian jurymen (Balb. 11** cf. Val. Max. 2.10.1** Badian, Rom. Imp. 103, note 19) favors a time before the Lex Servilia Caepionis in 106, and preferably before his consulship. Otherwise it might possibly be dated to the short interval between his triumph in 106 and the passage of the law. See also Gruen, RPCC 132-133. Proconsul 108-106. See MRR 1.549, 551, 554. Degrassi takes milites Africa(niJ Caecilianis (ILS 2489-ILLRP 146) to be Metellus' soldiers in the Jugurthine war who had returned with him and received allotments of land near Alba Fucens. See E. V. Marmorale (GIF 19, 1966, 183-184), who interprets Caecilianis, not as referring to the place of origin of the soldiers as Mommsen and Degrassi did, but as a nominative plural describing them as soldiers of Metellus Numidicus** cf. J. M. Reynolds, JRS 61, 1971, 140. E. Gabba accepts the form as a nominative plural, but suggests that the soldiers may have served under the son of Numidicus, Metellus Pius (98), in Africa or Spain (Revista de la Universidad Complutense 28, 1979 [19841, no. 118, 61-62).[40x]
