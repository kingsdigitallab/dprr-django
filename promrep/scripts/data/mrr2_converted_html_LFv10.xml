   2 Since the governors of Spain in 94 and 93, during and after the consulship of Caelius, are known, his term must precede that of Didius, who was assigned to Spain while Consul in 98. The emblem of the boar of Clunia on the coins which commemorate him suggest that his province was Nearer Spain (Graeber, CRRBM 1.475; cf. Wilsdorf, Leipzig. Stud. 1.110; Cesano, Stud. Num. 1.224f.). This is therefore the latest possible date for his praetorship, but he may have been a Praetor in 100 and a Promagistrate in 99.

   6 The father of Cato of Utica died before 91 (Plut. Cat. Min. 1.1). He had held the tribunate and was a candidate for the praetorship at the time of his death (Gell. 13.20.14). This tribunate is attributed in Drumann-Groebe (5.214) to L. Porcius Cato, Cos. 89, whose tenure of the office is not independently attested, but by Niccolini (FTP 205) to Cato's father. On the order of the husbands of Livia, Cato's mother, see Münzer, APF 295-297.

   7 When accused of maiestas, probably in 98, Titius was convicted, mainly because he kept an image of Saturninus in his house (Cic. De Or. 2.48 and 265; Rab. .Perd. 24; Val. Max. 8.1, damn. 3; cf. Cic. Brut. 225; De Or. 2.253).

   8 The coins in question contain the forms Ap. Cl., T. Mal., and Q. Urb. The variations in the order of the first two indicate that the third is rightly interpreted by Mommsen and Grueber to mean Q(uaestores) Urb(ani), not Q. Turb(inius). Claudius should most probably be identified with the Praetor of 89 (who, though Grueber disagrees, may also be the legionary commander of the name in 87 and the Interrex of 78; see these years), and therefore Mommsen's tentative suggestion of 99, ten years earlier, for his quaestorship a reasonably approximate date. Mallius is not otherwise known. Cichorius, quoting ILS 8888, is inclined to read Mal(oleius) and to identify this Quaestor with one of the officers of Pompeius Strabo (RS 146), but the occurrence of the name Mallius in Roman public office in 143 and 105 favors its retention here.

   1 In all magistracies except the tribunate and the censorship Crassus and Scaevola were colleagues (Cic. Brut. 16 1). On the date, see note 2. 
  </footnote>
  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark13">
   2 This is the latest possible date in view of the date of his consulship. Balsdon has shown (CR 51 [1937] 8-10) that the phrase in Asconius, provinciam ..... deposuerat (15 C), refers to his consulship, when his colleague Crassus was demanding a triumph, and means not that he left his province, which would demand the verb decedere, but that he refused at that time to go to a province at all. Magie in his important recent work, Roman Rule in Asia Minor (2.1064, note 47) returns to the view that Scaevola's governorship of Asia followed his consulship, since otherwise the interval between the acts of Scaevola's Legate, Rutilius Rufus, and his prosecution in 92 would be inexplicably long. The interval however was greater in the case of C. Norbanus (see 103, Tribunes of the Plebs), and of C. Antonius (see 84, Prefects, and 76 Praetors, on M. Lucullus). The balance of political factors in Rome may well have had much to do with the date of the trial of Rutilius. It is unlikely that Scaevola assumed command of Asia during the year of his praetorship, for he remained in his province only nine months (Cic. Att. 5.17.5), and his title while there was Proconsul (Liv. Per. 70; cf. OGIS 437 and 439; see 97, Promagistrates).
  </footnote>
  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark14">
   3 Later practice, as in the case of Julius Caesar, who was Curule Aedile in 65 and Iudex Quaestionis in 64, favors placing the date, even in this early pre-Sullan instance, in the year after his aedileship (see 99, Aediles).
  </footnote>
  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark15">
   4 The date is established by the phrase # in Diodorus (36. 10) describing Metellus' exile, and by the statement in Schol. Bob. (176 Stangl) that his summons to return came from Metellus Nepos (a Consul this year) and Metellus Pius (his son).

  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark16">
   5 Niccolini (FTP 205-210) holds that our sources are confused, so that there was only one prosecution of Furius, and the word Canuleius is simply a mistake on Appian's part for Appuleius. Wehrmann (Volkstrib. 4) and Klebs (RE S. v. "Appuleius" 21) maintain that there was only one action brought by Appuleius and Canuleius together, while Ziegler (Trib. 18) and Von der Mühll (Saturninus 97 ff.) favor two actions of differing issue. This view agrees best with the evidence we have. Furius, who had joined the conservative side and was a personal enemy of Metellus Numidicus, was acquitted when prosecuted by a partisan of Saturninus but did not survive an action based on his enmity for Numidicus.

   2 This is the latest date possible for his praetorship under the Leges Annales. His severity may be due to the recent suppression of the slave revolt in Sicily, and would indicate that he was probably the successor of Aquillius (see 99, Promagistrates), in which case his term began in 98 at the latest (see however Klein, 58, no. 64). if his title as Praetor is used like that of Verres in Sicily he may have held the praetorship in Rome before going to Sicily as Propraetor.

   6 Pomponius' statement (Dig. 1.2.2.40) that Rutilius was a Proconsul in Asia is probably an error for Legatus, or Legatus pro praetore, as he might have been called in the months after Seaevola's return. If Rutilius was ever Proconsul in Asia it was either ca. 117 B. C. after his praetorship or in 104 after his consulship. His case became a proverbial example of unjust condemnation.

   7 Cicero's statement that Marius was elected an Augur under the Lex Domitia (see 104, Tribunes of the Plebs) while absent in Cappadocia indicates clearly that the order of offices in the Elogia gives no clue to the date. Marius was present in Rome in 98 at the trial of Aquillius (Cic De Or. 2.196), but thereafter departed to the East to pay a vow to the Magna Mater (Plut. Mar. 3 1. 1), perhaps pursuant to the special visit of the Battaces to Rome in 102 (Diod. 36.13; Plut. Mar. 17.5-6), and while there gave Mitbridates in Cappadocia a warning against his expansionist policies (Plut. Mar. 31.2-3). As he left Rome before the return of Metellus Numidicus in 98 this is the most probable year for his election to the augurate.

   2 Nasica's title is not preserved, nor is the date absolutely certain. Wilsdorf (Leipzig. Stud. 1.112),places the Consul Flaccus in Nearer Spain against the Celtiberi, and Nasica therefore in Farther Spain (see 92, Promagistrates, on Flaccus). A date in 93 is perhaps more probable than the 94 favored by the order of the passage in Obsequens, since the two incumbent governors in Spain, Didius and Crassus, did not celebrate their triumphs until June 10 and 12, respectively, of 93 (see Promagistrates). Nasica's praetorship is not.mentioned, though his eminence and connections (Cic. Brut. 2 11; De Or. 3.134; Rose. Amer. 77; Dio 40.51.3) as well as his command make it probable that he held it.

   6 The date and character of his legatio remain uncertain. As it was the object of Caepio's attack in 92 this is the latest possible date, but the state of Scaurus' health in his later years and the analogy with Rutilius Rufus both point to a date considerably earlier. Bloch (Aemilius Scaurus 27-33) favors one before 100 B. G. According to Asconius (21 C; cf. Val. Max. 8.1, abs. 10) Caepio accused Scaurus under the Lex Servilia de repetundis for pecunia capta during a legatio Asiatica; but according to Valerius Maximus (3.7.8) Varius in 91 returned to an attack he had made before (Ascon. 22 C) under his Lex de maiestate to accuse him of accepting a bribe from Mithridates to betray the state. Though the phrase legatio Asiatica and the analogy of Rutilius Rufus suggest that Scaurus had once been on the staff of a governor of Asia, the evidence of Valerius Maximus suggests membership of some one of the many embassies to Mithridates between 104 and 93, but which remains impossible to determine (see Th. Reinach, Mithridates Eupator 88-99 [trans. Goetz]; Bloch, op. cit. 27-33).

     Valerius Flaccus, though appointed to Asia in his consulship (see 86, Consuls), was killed by Fimbria before he reached his province. The provincial collections therefore for a festival in his honor which were deposited at Tralles before the Mithridatic War (Cic. Flacc. 55-61.) indicate that he had been governor of Asia either during, or more probably after, his praetorship. As he had held the aedileship in 99 his governorship would probably follow that of Mucius Scaevola in 91 and precede that of C. Iulius Caesar about 91. See Sternkopf, Jahrb. f. Cl. Philol. 155 (1897) 573-576; and Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor 2.1242, note 1.

   1 1 On Perperna's grandfather, see Degrassi 126, on 130 B. C., who is inclined to identify him with a Legate to Gentius of Illyria in 168 (Liv. 44.27.11). The word Nepos in Chr. 354 shows that the line of descent was given and disproves the story in Valerius Maximus (3.4.5) that the present Consul's father was expelled from Rome after his son's consulship for illegally assuming Roman citizenship.

  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark45">
   2 These Elogia, and the place of the Iulii in Cicero's list in Rab. Perd. 21, both indicate that the career of Caesar's father should be dated mainly between 100 and 90 B. C. (see Broughton, AJA 52 [1948] 323-330). If he held the quaestorship soon after 100 his praetorship and his proconsulate in Asia should be placed as late as possible before the command there of L. Cassius. Accordingly I suggest 92 for his praetorship and 91 for his proconsulate.

   7 Appian implies that the revolt which was crushed by Flaccus (almost certainly Valerius Flaccus) followed soon upon the operations of Didius in Spain (see 93, Promagistrates), and preceded by a considerable interval the wars between the followers of Sulla and Marius. Wilsdorf (Leipzig. Stud. 1. 112) therefore has a good basis for placing him as Consul or Proconsul in Nearer Spain about this time. He appears in 83 in command of Narbonese Gaul and in 81 celebrated a triumph ex Celtiberia et Gallia, perhaps including a reference to his earlier victory (see 83-81, Promagistrates). See however Münzer, Gent. Val. 42, no. 26, and Jashemski (126), who are inclined to date his Spanish command with his Gallic one.

Münzer (RE) believes that it is a title.

   2 The Cn. Octavius Cn. f. who appears second in the list of members of the consilium of Cn. Pompeius Strabo at Asculum in 89, just after the name of L. Gellius, Pr. 94, was probably an ex-Praetor at that time and may be identified with the Octavius Ruso who held the quaestorship in 105.

   3 Since the Legates in the consular armies of 90 B. C. as listed in App. BC 1.40 were ex-Consuls or ex-Praetors, C. Perperna must have held the praetorship by 91. Münzer suggests 92, the consulship of M. Perperna.

   4 Servilius is termed Praetor in Vell., Diod., and Oros., who also applies the title Legate to him, but Proconsul in Liv. and App. He was either a Praetor, who had received an imperium pro consule, as Mommsen thinks (Str. 2.235), or the incident occurred very early in 90 B. C. This date is not impossible as the death of Livius Drusus did not occur until autumn (Cic. De, Or. 1.24, still alive in mid September). We are not told the status of a certain Domitius who met a body of Italians under Pompaedius marching on Rome and dissuaded them (Diod. 37.13.1-2).

   5 Though nowhere specifically termed a Praetor, Servilius Caepio's position among the ex-Consuls and ex-Praetors who served as Legates in the Social War indicates that he had held the office (see 90, Legates). In 91 he was nine years beyond his quaestorship. He was not, so far as we know, prosecuted directly in that year, but Drusus did use against him the threat which Tribunes usually reserved for magistrates in office: that of hurling him from the Tarpeian rock (Auct. Vir. Ill. 66.8 and 13; cf. Cic. Dom. 120; Plin. NH 28.148). His attack on Scaurus in 92 drew upon him a counter-accusation, perhaps of ambitus in his candidacy (Ascon. 21 C; Flor. 2.5.5). See Münzer, APF 300.

   6 Galba's Position in Lucania at the outbreak of the Social War (Liv. Per. 72) seems similar to that of Q. Servilius at Aseulum. In the list of Pompeius Strabo's consilium at Asculum in 89 Cichorius supplies the name [Ser. Sulpi]cius C. f. Ani(ensi), who was probably a Legate of praetorian rank (ILS 8888; Cichorius, RS 137-139).

If he did not immediately succeed his brother Livius Drusus he probably soon succeeded to the place of some patrician. See L. R. Taylor, AJPh 63 (1942) 391-393, 401f., 411.

That Cinna's colleague in the consulship of 86, L. Valerius Flaccus, was also a patrician exemplifies the illegalities of a period when there was neither mos nor ius (of.

   6 Cicero lists Caesar Strabo among the magistrates of 90 (Brut. 305), and Varro records a phrase he uttered as aedilicius before the Censors of 89.

   8 Niccolini (FTP 223) has rightly seen that there were two persons named C. Carbo active at this time. The filiation of one was C. f., and of the other Cn. f., who was therefore a brother of the Consul of 85, 84, and 82. Both attained praetorships, and both died in the civil wars, Arvina at Rome in 82 (confused by Velleius with the brother of the Consul), and the other at Volaterrae in 81 (Gran. Lic. 39 B; Val. Max. 9.7, ext. 3). Niccolini has shown that Cicero in Brut. 305 lists the Tribunes of 90, not of 90 and 89. The Tribune of 90 is most probably the orator who is designated as C. f. and Tribune in Orator 213. The Tribune who was co-author of the Lex Plautia Papiria in 89 was Cn. f., the brother of the future Consul. To Niccolini's arguments for a date in 90 a decisive addition is Cicero's presence at the meeting Carbo held, for Cicero served in the Social War in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (Phil. 12.27) and later in the same year under Sulla at Nola (Plut. Cic. 3.1; Cic. Div. 1.72; 2.65), and probably had little opportunity to hear the Tribunes of 89. Furthermore, Carbo's apostrophe to Livius Drusus in Orator 213 implies that his death was recent. Niccolini's view has been accepted by Münzer (RE).

   11 Appian, after consistently calling Lucius Caesar, the Consul of this year, Sextus, places Sextus as Proconsul at Asculum in 89. This is impossible in both cases since Asculum was then under siege by Pompeius Strabo and Lucius Caesar became Censor in Rome. Münzer would transfer the notice in Appian to early 90 and refer it to the Consul of 91, whose praenomen really was Sextus. If Sex. Sul in Liv. Per. 73 (ed. Rossbach, p. 82, line 24) is correctly emended to Sex. Iul&lt;ius&gt; by Domaszewski (SBAW 201.1.25 f.), he won a victory over the Paeligni early in 90; but see below, Legates, on Ser.

   13 Cicero does not make it clear whether Cornutus served under the Consuls of 90 or of 89 or of both years, though he was among "tum... praetorios belli gerendi peritissimos." Cichorius (RS 140f.) supplied his name in third place on the staff of Pompeius Strabo (ILS 8888) as a praetorian Legate, and concludes from Sisenna fr. 20 Peter (where he emends Commutus to Cornutus) that he also served in 90. Could the Legate Caecilius in Liv. Per. 76 really be Cornutus and not Caecilius Pius? In Rossbach's text on p. 84, Pinna in line 19 has been emended to Cinna and the same word in line 20 to Pio although it may be merely a repetition.

   16 Appian lists Lentulus among the subordinate commanders under the Consul, several of whom are specifically termed Legates in the Latin sources, a description which fits Catulus, but is not otherwise attested for Lentulus. Cichorius (RS 140, note 1) would substitute Catulus' name, but Domaszewski disagrees (SBAW 201 [1924] 1.20), even though Catulus (see below) was certainly a Legate in 90. We cannot safely assume that Appian listed all the Legates Under the Consuls, and therefore a difference in the number assigned to each need not be significant.

   18 If the reading Sex. Sul in Liv. Per. 73 (ed. Rossbach, p. 82, line 24) which refers to the commander who defeated the Paeligni in 90, designates Sex. Iulius Caesar (see above, note 11), not Ser. Sulpicius - which seems preferable on account of the following word Paelignos, - we have no sure means of determining whether the Sulpicius who was a Legate of Pompeius Strabo in 90 and 89 was Ser. Sulpicius Galba, or P. Sulpicius Rufus, who was a Legate, we do not know Under whom, in 89, and may have been so in 90. Cichorius (RS 137-139, and 14 1) supplies the name [Ser. Sulpi]cius C. f. Ani(ensi) in ILS 8888 for the fourth in order of the staff of Pompeius Strabo in 89, and also identifies him with the Sulpicius Galba who served as a Legate under Sulla in the war with Mithridates (see 87, Legates). If Cichorius' suggestion is correct it excludes Rufus, who held the tribunate of the plebs in 88, since the praenomen Gaius is not found among the Sulpicii Rufi and they were registered in the Lemonian tribe (Cic. Phil. 9.15 and 17; ef. Joseph. AJ 14.220).

Pomp. 1). A Lex Pompeia confirmed the citizenship of the Cispadane towns in Gaul, the Latin right of the Transpadane ones, and attached native tribes to some of these towns (Ascon. X; Plin.

   1 If these Censors were expected to register the new citizens admitted under the Julian, Calpurnian, and Plautian and Papirian laws, they failed in their task (see 90, Consuls; above, Tribunes of the Plebs; Cram, HSCPh 51 [1940] 100; RE, as above). No clear decision was reached in their time regarding the mode of registration or the number of tribes concerned. An important factor in their election may have been the failure of the Censors of 92 to complete the census and found the lustrum. These Censors founded it anyway.

Vir. Ill. 75.7-8; Oros 5.19.3-7). Meantime, Pompeius co-operated with Sulla against Sulpicius and in the occupation of Rome (Liv. Per. 77; App. BC 1.59; cf - Cic. Lael. 2). He was given command of the army of Pompeius Strabo, who in turn is suspected of inciting the mutiny in which the Consul Pompeius was later killed (Liv. Per. 77; Vell. 2.20.1; Val. Max. 9.7, ext. 2; App. BC 1.63). They carried a series of measures, one for the exile of the Marian partisans (Vell. 2.19.1; Flor. 2.9.6-8), a second providing that all measures be considered by the Senate before submission to an assembly, a third that laws be carried only in the Comitia Centuriata, a fourth putting some further limitation on the Tribune5 (App. BC 1.59; cf. Liv. Per. 77), a fifth adding 300 personnss to the Senat,9 (App.), a sixth regarding colonies (Liv.), and a seventh applying interest payments on the principal of debts (Fest. 516L), perhaps also one limiting the application of the sponsio (Gaius 3.124). Sulla held the elections and, after securing the oath of the Consulselect Cinna wid Octavius to support his measures (Plut. Sull. 10.3-4; Dio 30-35, fr. 102.3-4), departed for the war with Mithridates (see also Jacoby, -FGrH 2B.1151, no. 252).

   2 A solution for the knotty problem of the date of Scipio's command in Illyricum (or Macedonia) has been suggested by G. Daux (Delphes aux IIe et au Ier siecle 392-397). As against Pomtow (RhM 51 [1896] 329 ff., esp. 364-376), he keeps the Ms reading in Appian #, and accepts in Plutarch the emendation of # to # in # (see A.-J. Reinach, BCH 34 L 1910] 249-330, esp. 313-32 1; Münzer, RE, Supb. 3.26 1). Eusebius's synchronism of the burning of the temple at Delphi (exaggerated) and that of the Capitolium in Rome falls into place. It remains difficult to explain Appian's reference to 32 years since the first conflicts between Romans and Celts. Perhaps his number should be emended to 302, i. e., since 387 B. C., otherwise it may refer to the triumph of Metellus Delmaticus 32 years before in 117. For earlier discussions, see Gäbler, RE s. v. "Makedonia," 766 (dates Scipio in 88); and Zippel, Römische Herrschaft in Illyricum 190.

   3 Valerius' title is not recorded. Münzer (Gent. Val. 42) holds that there was an interval between his consulship and the command from which he triumphed (see 81, Promagistrates). From Cicero it appears that he was governor of Gaul in 83, but the fragment of the Pro Flacco preserved in Schol. Bob. indicates that the son of the L. Valerius Flaccus, Cos. 86, who was hilled in Asia by Fimbria, took refuge in Gaul with his uncle, presumably in 85. The coins are dated by Grueber to 83 and later, when Cicero tells us he was using the title Imperator.

In the Greek inscriptions (see 83, and 81, Promagistrates) he is termed Imperator, and according to Cicero (Mur. 15) celebrated his triumph ex praetura in 81. Unless he held the praetorship by 87 he could have secured regular election only in 81. Here as elsewhere Cicero may be referring to the holder of an imperium pro praetore (Sulla's acts were all validated later by the Senate) as Praetor and his office as praetura.

   1 Although Münzer (RE) is inclined to date the death of Papirius Carbo early in 8 1, 1 think it probable that he was put to death before the end of 82. Valerius Maximus twice refers to his death in his third consulship (6.2.8; 9.13.2), and Fast. Cap. probably contained a similar notice (see Degrassi 54f., 130), While Appian places the death of both Consuls before the appointment of an Interrex and Sulla's assumption of the dictatorship (BC 1.98). This event is listed in Fast. Cap. between the Consuls of 82 and 8 1. Pompey, who captured Carbo at Cossyra and put him to death at Lilybaeum, was probably sent to Sicily before the battle at the Colline Gate and the capture of Praeneste (See Promagistrates, on Pompey; and note 2).
  </footnote>
  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark155">
   2 The exact date of the beginning of Sulla's dictatorship is not stated in our sources, but must be later than the battle at the Colline Gate on November 1 (Vell. 2.27.1). Both Consuls died in office (Val. Max. 6.2.8; 9.13.2) before the appointment of the Interrex and Sulla's election (App. BC 1.98). Massacres and the proscription had begun immediately after November 1 before the death of the Consuls (Oros. 5.20.9). The date must therefore be placed at an interval, probably a short interval, after November 1 and before the end of the year. This inference finds support in the analogy which Cicero finds (Att. 9.15.2) between the position of Caesar in 49 and that of Sulla in 82. Lange (3.153f.) holds that the regular continuance of the tribunate of the plebs is an indication that Sulla became Dictator and carried some of his legislation before the Tribunes of 81 entered office on December 10. Possibly so, but I doubt if this is decisive evidence, since the leges sacratae protected the tribunate from interruption. See Careopino, Sylla 47.

   5 On the identification of Lentulus, see RE. Mommsen (SPAW 1892. 845) distinguished him from the Praetor named in Cic. Arch. 9 (after 89 B.C.) and doubted that he should be dated in this period, but Münzer (RE) and the editors of SIG³ have identified the first name on the inscription as that of Sulla. The date is about 82 B.C., since Sulla is not termed Dictator and Murena has been acclaimed Imperator (see below).

   6 Some of the events referred to in these passages took place in 81 and some in 80, but the process began in 82, and many of them cannot be assigned to any specific year. The proscriptions ended officially on June 1, 81 (Cic. Rosc. Amer. 128), but even then the reign of terror was by no means finished. I have gathered the references here for the sake of convenience.

     Lepidus quarreled with his colleague, attempted to prevent giving funeral honors to Sulla, and, proposing a program to restore the powers of the tribunate, to carry new grain laws, and restore the confiscated lands to their former owners, began an insurrection, while Catulus became the leader of the opposing forces (Cic.

   4 Münzer's identification of Cosconius with the commander in Apulia in 89 seems very probable (RE), but the precise date of his command in Illyricum remains uncertain. War there probably began in 78 and ended in 76 (Eutrop. 6. 1. 1; 6.4). It had certainly ended before 74, when M. Atilius Bulbus, who was convicted of maiestas for tampering with the legions of Cosconius (Cic.), served as a juror in the trial of Oppianicus (Cic. Cluent. 71-72 and 97; Verr. 1.39).

   5 Eutropius (6.3) and Orosius (5.23.22) refer to the campaigns of Servilius Vatia Isauricus as a three year war. Orinerod (JRS 12 [1922] 37 ff.) is probably correct in supposing that 78 was given up to preparations (cf. Flor. 1.41.4) while the main operations were carried through in 77 to 75.

   2 Münzer assumes from the terminology that Peducaeus held the praetorship in Sicily in 76 and was continued as Propraetor in 75, but the terms Praetor and praetura as they are used both in this ease and in that of Verres may refer to the whole period of their governorships (Cic. Verr. 2.2.138-140, and 3.156 and 216 see 93, Promagistrates, on Sentius and Gellius). The career of Pedueaeus probably followed the normal post-Sullan pattern: he was a Praetor in Rome in 77, and Propraetor in Sicily in 76 and 75.

   4 Klein (241f., no. 25) is inclined to identify this Interrex with the Consul of 54, a son of the man listed above. He would still be quite youthful for the position. However, it is probable that the illness of the Proconsul had brought him home and made him available to perform this service before going to Macedonia. If so, the triumph of Dolabella (see below, Promagistrates), which Degrassi (564) is inclined to date in 78, may have been celebrated in 77. Iulius Caesar, who served under Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia in 78, and returned to Rome after receiving news of Sulla's death (Suet. Iul. 3), could then bring his accusation against Dolabella in 77.

   7 Cichorius (RS 193f.) suggests that after the death of Memmius (see 76, Quaestors) Varro became a Legatus pro quaestore (Grueber, CRRBM 2.362f., Varro proqu. Magn. procos.), and refers the coins with this title to this period. Mommsen, Grueber (loc. cit.) and, most recently, Sydenham (see Catalogue of his collection, p. 53, no. 337) attribute both them and the closely associated coins of Cn. Piso (see above, Promagistrates) to the period between 52 and 49 B.C. on the evidence of coin hoards. This seems reasonable in the case of Piso (see PIR² 2.57, no. 286), but in 49 Varro's title was Legatus pro praetore (see 49, Legates). The Proquaestor in Spain under Pompey, if correctly dated in 49, is probably another Varro.

     In Rome Lucullus checked the Tribune Quinctius (Sall. Hist. 3.48.11 M; see Tribunes of the Plebs). He had been assigned the province of Cisalpine Gaul, but upon the death of Octavius, Proconsul in Cilicia, early in the year (see Promagistrates), he intrigued to get this province and the command against Mithridates (Plut. Luc. 6-7; App. Mith. 72; cf. Cic. Mur. 33; Acad. 2.1; Sall. Hist. 2.98M, at the end). He received also command of the former armies of Fimbria and of Servilius Isauricus (Cic. Flacc. 85; Sall.

   1 Additonal Note. The dates of the activities of Lucullus in Asia Minor depend upon two disputed questions. The first and major one is the date of the outbreak of the Third Mithridatic War, and the second is the date when the province of Asia was added to his command.
   Many distinguished scholars, including Mommsen, T. Rice Holmes, Gelzer, and Ormerod, have supported the view that this war broke out in the spring of 74, and another distinguished group, including T. Reinach, Geyer, Brandis, and most recently, Magic, have decided in favor of the spring of 73. 1 see no certain solution, but believe that the weight of evidence on the whole supports the earlier date and have arranged the lists accordingly. According to Eutropius (6.6) Nicomedes died in the consulship of Lucullus and Cotta, and the evidence of Bithynian coins indicates that the date was at any rate later than October of 75. It may have been very early in 74 or even, given some slight inexactitude on the part of Eutropius, have occurred at the end of 75. According to Cicero Lucullus and Cotta were sent to the war during their consulship (Mur. 33), but in another passage (Acad. 2. 1) Cicero, after referring to the industry and ability of Lucullus in his consulship, adds the phrase post ad Mithridaticum bellum missus. And it is not clear whether post means "after your consulship" or "after these praiseworthy acts in your consulship." Appian makes a close relation between the election of Lucullus as Consul and his choice as commander in the war (Mith. 72), and Plutarch (Luc. 5-6) connects Pompey's threatening letter demanding men and money for his Spanish campaign, which was read in the Senate at the beginning of the consular year 74, with the ambition of Lucullus to exchange his assigned province of Cisalpine Gaul for the promising eastern command, and makes clear that the expectation of a war was immediate when news came of the death of Octavius, governor of Cilicia. According to both the Periochae of Livy and Eutropius fighting began when Lucullus and Cotta were Consuls, and in answer to the claim that the word consules is as often used loosely for proconsules it should be noted that the epitomizer of Livy distinguishes between the commencement of operations when Lucullus was Consul (Liv. Per. 94) and his victory at Cyzicus when he was Proconsul (Per. 95).
   Moreover in estimating the time to be allowed for the opposition in Rome between Lucullus and the Tribune Quinctius, it should be remembered that Tribunes, who entered upon office on the tenth of December, were usually most active at the beginning of their year of office, and that Lucullus did induce Quinctius to restrain himself before long.
   The most important evidence against a date in the spring of 74 is found in Velleius (2.33. l): cum esset in fine bellum piraticum et L. Lucullus, qui ante septem annos ex consulatu sortitus Asiam Mithridati oppositus erat ..., who goes on to mention the introduction of the Manilian law. The collocation of the phrase ex consulatu with a date seven years before the passage of the Manilian law in early 66 points to 73. Yet it is not irrelevant to point out that the war with the pirates was actually in fine if not confeclum by midsummer of 67 (Cic. Leg. Man. 35, media aestate confecit), and the phrase sortitus Asiam appears to be inaccurate since his province by sortition had been Cisalpine Gaul. And he was appointed to Cilicia before he received the governorship of Asia.
   The transport of an army to Asia need not have taken very long. Lucullus brought only one legion with him (Plut. Luc. 7.1; App. Mith. 72), which may have been recruited from the beginning of the year, and of his forces in Asia Minor two legions had recently seen service under Servilius Isauricus. It was quite possible for him to begin active operations in Phrygia by the autumn.
   [106x] Admittedly this scheme compresses a good deal of action into one year. Is it possible to do so? Cisalpine Gaul
   had probably been made consular before the elections in 75 in accordance with the Sempronian law. The danger from Mithridates was already evident in that year (Sall. Hist. 2.47.7 M). Early in 74, while Lucullus was attempting to meet Pompey's demands and his various civil duties, came the news of the death of Nicomedes of Bithynia, and soon afterwards of Octavius, governor of Cilicia, either in or on his way to his province (Balsdon has shown that even after Sulla's reforms Consuls often departed for their provinces before the end of their year of office in Rome, JRS 29 [1939] 58-63). Meantime, Iuncus, then governor of Asia, moved into Bithynia to organize the new inheritance, and the entrance of Roman tax-gatherers roused irritation in the cities, especially in the free city of Heracleia. It appears that Iuncus was in Bithynia when Caesar was captured by pirates and then captured his captors, an event that in view of his return to Italy in 73 seems best dated in the winter of 75-74 (Vell. 2.41.3-42.3; Suet. Iul. 4, and 74.1; Plut. Crass. 1.4.2-3; Auct. Vir. 1ll. 78.3; cf. Plut. Crass. 7.5; Polyaen. 8.23.1; Fenestella, GLK 1.365), since he had time both for study at Rhodes and operations in Asia against officers of Mithridates before his return (Suet.). Of Heracleia it should be noted that it did not go over to Mithridates at once, and also that it did not have or take time to send an embassy to Rome to protest its rights. The interval of time before it went over to Mithridates was probably not great (Memnon 38 in FGrH 3B.355). Lucullus secured the province of Cilicia by intrigue and in consequence the command against Mithridates by general consent, probably by midsummer at the latest. He and his single legion could have reached Ephesus and from there Phrygia by early autumn where the legions already mobilized were already concentrated. The action at Cyzicus is known to have been a winter campaign (Plut. Luc. 33.3).
   Is a date in 74 for the beginning of the war consistent with the course of the war itself? The siege of Amisus was also a winter operation (Plut. Luc. 33.3), either in 73-72 or in 72-71. Phlegon of Tralles places the march of Lucullus from Amisus to Cabira in the first year of the 177th Olympiad (July 72-July 71) and has him spend the subsequent winter there. This implies that the defeat of Mithridates and his flight to Armenia should be placed in the latter part of 72. According to Memnon (55) a year and eight months passed after this before Tigranes of Armenia accorded the defeated monarch a personal reception. Appian places this reception near the time of the battle of Tigranocerta in the autumn of 69 (Mith. 85), thus suggesting that the flight of Mithridates should be placed in 71, but Plutarch (Luc. 22. 1) and Memnon (55, cf. 46) clearly imply that the reception followed immediately upon Tigranes' refusal to surrender him to Lucullus' envoy, Ap. Claudius Pulcher, in the spring of 70, and support the view that the flight of Mithridates should be dated in 72.
   In Cat. 3.9 Cicero refers to the year 63 as the annus decimus post virginum absolutionem, a trial in which M. Pupius Piso, a man older than Cicero, had gained renown after a temporary eclipse in his career (1~rut. 236). Two such trials are known in this period, one, of Licinia (for incest with Crassus, at some time when he was no longer a youth, see 73, Vestal Virgins), is undated, and one, of Fabia, for incest with Catiline, is dated by Orosius to the year of the relief of Cyzicus (6.3.1). There is no proof that the trials to which Cicero refers included the trial of Fabia, but it is very tempting to suppose that the two trials that are mentioned in this period were the same ones, and that 73 was the date of the relief of Cyzicus.
   [107x] I am therefore inclined to assign as follows the activities of Lucullus' command between the years 74 and 69:
   74. Outbreak of the Mithridatic war, appointment to Cilicia, perhaps also to Asia. 74-73. Siege of Mithridates at Cyzicus.
   73. Clearing of much of Bithynia, and beginning of the invasion of Pontus. 73-72. Siege of Amisus.
   72. Defeat of Mithridates at Cabira. His flight to Armenia.
   71. Capture of other cities of Pontus. Lucullus returns to Asia.
   70. Lucullus completes his reforms in Asia and returns to Pontus.
   69. Lucullus invades Armenia.
   The second question remains. There is no doubt that Lucullus became Proconsul of Asia by 71 (Cic. Flacc. 85; see above, Consuls), and that his appointment to Asia was subsequent to the Cilician one. Noting that Varinius held a praetorship in 73 and was at some time governor of Asia (see 73, Praetors; and 65, Promagistrates) Lange suggested that he should be placed in 72 and the governorship of Lucullus in 71. The phrase in Velleius ante septem annos ex consulatu sortitus Asiam points to 73 however inexact the word sortitus may actually be (see above). According to Menmon (37) Lucullus was sent to Asia by the Senate, and Plutarch has him proceed directly there. It seems to me probable therefore that Lucullus became governor of Asia some years before 71- 70, the dates which are most clearly attested, and that Asia was added to his command when it became clear in Rome in the autumn of 74 that his most immediate military task lay in that province. Against a date in 71 may be urged the fact that with the resurgence of popular agitation, at that time supported by Pompey, and with two
   Pompeians in the consulship in 72, the political climate in Rome was extremely unfavorable to additions to the sphere of command of Lucullus.
   For discussions of these problems, with references to earlier literature, see T. Rice Holmes, The Roman Republic 1.398-403; and Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor, 2.1204, note 5, and 1127, note 47.

   2 Livy terms Antonius praetor, while Cicero refers to his imperium infinitum, and Ps.-Ascon. to his curatio infinita. According to Velleius the Senate decreed to Antonius in praetura the same imperium as Pompey later received under the Gabinian law: imperium aequum in omnibus provinciis cum proconsulibus usque ad quinquagesimum, miliarium a mari.

   6 The dates of Fonteius' command in Gaul have been disputed, and the beginning has been placed as early as 77 (Maurenbrecher on Sall. Hist. p. 227 f.). He was in command of Gaul when Pompey wintered there with his army, therefore either in 77-6 or in 74-3 (see above, on Pompey). Cicero's reference to cavalry which he sent from Gaul to Roman wars over all the world, and the length of his tenure of command both favor the later date (cf. however, Jullian, Histoire de la Gaule 3. 111, note 1). As in the case of Verres and elsewhere, Cicero uses the term praetor to cover also the years of prorogued imperium. (Font. 11 and 16).

   7 One of these men referred to as Mamercus may possibly be identified with Mam. Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, Cos. 77. The most important evidence against a date in the spring of 74 is found in Velleius (2.33. l): cum esset in fine bellum piraticum et L. Lucullus, qui ante septem annos ex consulatu sortitus Asiam Mithridati oppositus erat ..., who goes on to mention the introduction of the Manilian law. The collocation of the phrase ex consulatu with a date seven years before the passage of the Manilian law in early 66 points to 73. Yet it is not irrelevant to point out that the war with the pirates was actually in fine if not confeclum by midsummer of 67 (Cic. Leg. Man. 35, media aestate confecit), and the phrase sortitus Asiam appears to be inaccurate since his province by sortition had been Cisalpine Gaul. And he was appointed to Cilicia before he received the governorship of Asia.

   1 The name of Claudius is preserved in full in SIG³ 747. The epitomizer of Livy mistakenly calls him Pulcher and gives his title as Legatus, while Appian has combined the names of the two Praetors into the single name Varinius Glaber (see Münzer, Philologue 55 [1896] 387-389) and probably substituted the name P. Valerius for Varinius. As the operations of Varinius began in the autumn of 73 (Sall. Hist. 2.86 M) and probably continued into 72 there may be a sound basis for the title procos. attributed to him in Frontinus.

   5 In I. v. Olymp. 328 a certain Q. Ancharius is honored by the Koffion of the Achaeans while Proquaestor, but it remains uncertain whether he should be identified with this officer under Antonius, or whether he held the position at some other time under a governor of Macedonia. 6 Foucart recognized that SIG³ 748 refers to events between 74 and 71 and to the command of Antonius Creticus (Jour. des Savants 1906, 569-81; cf. Hatzfold, Italiens traliquants dans l´Orient hellenique 81, note 3). C. Iulius is most probably to be identified with the future Dictator, who had left Rome for Rhodes in 75 and early in 74 captured pirates who had held him for ransom, and during that year had aided in the defence of south-western Asia Minor against supporters of Mithridates (Vell. 2.41-2; Val. Max. 6.9.15; Suet. Iul. 4.2; 74.1; cf. Plut. Caes. 1.4-.4; Polyaen. 8.23.1, who misdate the incident 6f the pirates). He returned to Rome in 73 upon receiving news of his cooptation to the college of Pontifices (Vell. 2.43. 1 ; see Pontifices). If Foucart is correct in dating the year of Biadas at Gytheum. to 73-72 it is probable that Caesar then returned as a Legate under Antonius Creticus. It should be noted that another C. Iulius appears in this period, the obscure C. Iulius whom Catiline dispatched to Apulia in 63 (Sall. Cat. 21.1). But Caesar, since his known career is consistent with this appointment in 73-72, is the more probable identification. This dating supports Niccolini's view (FTP 251) that Caesar was elected a Tribune of the Soldiers for 71 and not for 72. On Caesar's legateship, see Broughton, TAPhA 79 (1948) 63-67.

   1 Pupius Piso is mentioned by Cicero with Curio and Lentulus Clodianus (Cic. Brut. 236). He celebrated a triumph as Proconsul from Spain in 69 (Ascon. 15 C; see Degrassi 565). It is therefore probable that he held the praetorship about 72, and proceeded to Spain the next year as successor to either Metellus or Pompey.

   2 The evidence regarding the date of the praetorship of Crassus is quite contradictory: in one passage (BC 1. 118) Appian remarks that in the third year of the war when other candidates in the praetorian elections were unwilling to come forward and undertake the command, Crassus offered himself, and in another (BC 1. 12 1) says that Crassus as a candidate for the consulship in 70 had held the praetorship "as the law of Sulla required." If Crassus followed the course regular in this period he held the praetorship in 73 and was invested with his command against Spartacus in 72 pro consule, as Eutropius says. The epitomator of Livy so frequently uses praetor in the sense of propraetor that his evidence is not decisive for the later date for Crassus' praetorship. Crassus therefore was probably Praetor in 73 and Proconsul in 72-71, and Appian correct only regarding his acceptance of the cominand when others were unwilling. He must have been in the field when the Consuls were in Rome in November (Cic. Verr. 2.2.95). See T. Rice Holmes, Roman Republic 1.389; Münzer, RE, on Crassus, col. 302; and against the view expressed above, D. -G. 4.91, note 5 and 6.

   1 The existence of the honored position of Princeps Senatus after the Sullan reforms remains a disputed point. It is certain that the person who was named first on the roll of the Senate lost much of his former importance because he was no longer called upon first for his opinion in Senate meetings (Gell. 14.7.9; and note for examples, Cic. Att. 1.13.2, and list in Mommsen, Str. 3.975, note 2). There were revisions of the roll of the Senate by the Censors of 70 (see above, on the exclusions), in which someone must have been listed first, as also in 61 (Die 37.46.4), perhaps in 55, since the Censors founded the lustrum, and in 50 (see 50, Censors, on the exclusions). Willems (1.115-123) suggested that beginning with the Censors of 70 there supervened a series of plebeian Principes Senatus, Q. Lutatius Catulus from 70 until his death in 61-60, P. Servilius Vatia Isauricus from 55 until his death in 44, and Cicero by decree of the Senate itself in 43. An examination of the passages adduced in support of these (Catulus: Cic. Pis. 6, princeps huius ordinis et auctor publici consili; Vell. 2.43.4, omnium confessionis senatus princeps; Plut. Vit. Pud. 15; Apophth. Cat.; Dio 36.30.4. Servilius: Schol. Gron. 322 Stangl, iste. florebat, in senatu princeps erat. Cicero : Phil. 14.18, si principatus ageretur, quam numquam expetivi; Fam. 12.24.2, me principem senatui populoque Romano professus sum; Cremutius Cordus in Senec. Suas. 6.19, princeps senatus Romanique nominis titulus) proves amply the high and influential position they held but indicates that the term princeps was probably used in a non-technical sense (see Mommsen, Str. 3.868, note 4). Mommsen holds that the honor was limited to patricians of the maiores gentes, and in practice given only to censorii or consulares (Ibid.). Accordingly the very insignificance of Mam. Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, Cos. 77, suggests that in Val. Max. 7.7.6 (conveniens Mamerco, conveniens principi senatus decretum) the term is technical and supports Mommsen's view. See Mommsen, Str. 3.868; RF 1.92-94; Rh. Mus. 19 (1864) 455-457.

The decisive points are: first, it must be placed in or after Caesar's military tribunate (71) and before his quaestorship (69; Suet. Iul. 5); second, it cannot be placed in the same year as the Lex Antonia de Termessensibus, when all the Tribunes are known; and third, as a tribunician bill it should probably follow the restoration of the powers of the Tribunes in 70. The Lex Antonia is excluded from 71 and 69 by the names of known Tribunes, and should probably be later than 70 in any case. The conditions of the problem are best met by dating the Lex Plautia in 70, the Lex Antonia in 68, while Caesar's military tribunate has been dated on other grounds to 71 and his quaestorship to 69 (see L. R. Taylor, CPh 36 [1941] 121, note 32).

   5 Afranius was Legate of Pompey in the war against Sertorius (see 75-72, Legates), and in the war against Mithridates (see 66-64, Legates). His praetorship, provincial command, and subsequent triumph (Cic. Pis. 58), since the latter cannot follow that of Pompey (Degrassi 565), must all be placed in the period between 72 and 67. 1 suggest 71 for his praetorship and 70-69 for his provincial command and triumph. The province is unknown, but might be one of the Spains or Transalpine Gaul (see Syme, JRS 28 [1938] 120, note 56; Degrassi 565, who suggests 70 as a possible date for the triumph).

   6 Both the exact date for the sending of the commission and the identification of Murena remain uncertain. The commissioners were appointed before 66 (Die 36.43.2) and were in Pontus before that time. The most suitable moment for their appointment would follow the complete occupation of Pontus in 70, and precede the invasion of Armenia (Plut. Luc. 24. 1; see Gelzer, RE, s. v. "Licinius" 104). A group of appointments, so strongly favorable to Lucullus, suggests the leadership of the Consuls of 69 rather than of 70, yet a political climate in Rome more favorable than that which set in in 69. Gelzer supposes that Murena was Sulla's former Legate (RE no. 122), once the superior officer of Lucullus in Asia (see 84-81, Promagistrates) and father of Lucullus' Legate, the future Consul of 62 (RE no. 123), but Münzer (RE no. 123) and Magic (Roman Rule in Asia Minor 2.1219, note 58) identify him with the son. Both men satisfy Cicero's statement that the commissioners were coniunctissimi ad L. Lucullum (Att. 13.6 a), but Cicero makes no reference to such a special position when describing the son's services in Pontus and Armenia (Mur. 20). The father was dead before 63 (Mur. 88 and 90), but the date is not indicated. See Broughton, TAPhA 77 (1946) 40-43.

   4 Sulpicius was not in office in 70 when Verres rejected him from the jury (Cic. Verr. 2.1.18), nor is it probable that he held the aedileship after 69, since he was a candidate for the consulship of 63 (Cic. Att. 1.1.1). Bardt (Priester 15), Seidel (FA 54f.), and Münzer (RE) place his aedileship in 71, believing him excluded from 69 by the aedileships of Cicero and Caesonius, but with L. R. Taylor's demonstration that they were almost certainly Aediles of the Plebs (see note 5), this year becomes available for Sulpicius. See Pontifices. The evidence above excludes Sydenharn's dating in 65 (page lxiv of his forthcoming work).

   5 Mommsen (Str. 1.443, note 2; 2.518-522; RF 1.100) and Seidel (FA) supposed that Cicero and his colleague Caesonius were Curule Aediles. The games however that Cicero gave were dedicated to Ceres, Liber and Libera, and to Flora (Verr. 2.5.36-37). He never refers to himself as Curule Aedile, or records giving the Megalesian games. The primi Romani ludi of Verr. 2.5.36-37 were probably not the Ludi Romani but the Ludi Plebeii. On the whole question, see L. R. Taylor, AJPh 60 (1939) 200, note 25.

   6 Mommsen (CIL 1, p. 172), and Niccolini (FTP 422-424) are inclined to refer the Lex Visellia to a bill regulating city affairs, particularly the assignment of road commissioners, passed before 71 B. C., the date to which they attribute both the Lex Antonia de Termessensibus and the Tribunes named both there and in the above inscription. To Niccolini this implies that the law was passed before 81 when legislative powers were taken from the Tribunes, and automatically excludes C. Visellius Varro, Cicero's cousin, from being the sponsor of the bill. If L. R. Taylor correctly dates the Lex Antonia in 68 (CPh 36 [1941] 121 f., note 32) the law can be attributed to Visellius Varro and dated in 70 or 69. Varro was a Military Tribune in Asia in 79-78 (Cic. Verr. 2.1.71), a senator of quaestorian rank in 73 (SIG³ 747), and Aedile at some unknown date, perhaps about 59 (see 59, Aediles; Seidel, Fast. Aed. 62). He probably held the tribunate in 70 or 69 and carried this law.

   7 It is generally assumed that Caesar held the quaestorship in 68 (D.-G. 3.135f.; Münzer, RE 10.189f.), but he was eligible for the office in 69. The legions levied for service in Cilicia which still remained in Cisalpine Gaul at the time of his return from Spain (Suet. IW. 8) almost certainly belonged to the forces of Marcius Rex, Cos. 68. Moreover, though he went to the province by spring or summer of his year he was able to return, ante tempus (Suet.), i.e., before his commander, in time to support the Gabinian law in early 67. He probably entered office Dec. 5, 70, went to his province in spring 69, and returned in the course of 68. The eulogies of his aunt and his wife would then precede his departure for Spain. See L. R. Taylor, CPh 36 (1941) 122f.

   13 Though the passages in Cic. Div. 1. 104, and Varro LL 6.21 could conceivably refer to L. Valerius Flaccus, Cos. 131, and Flamen Martialis (see 131), they are better referred to the Consul of 100, since Cicero's phrase in Rab. Perd. 27, in sacerdotio caerimoniisque quibus praeerat, distinguishes his duties from those of an ordinary Pontifex. The date of his death must fall between the cooptation of Caesar in 73 and that of Galba by or before 69 (see note 11). If it were certain that Metellus Pius was present at the inaugural banquet described in Macrobius it could be dated after his return from Spain in 71.

   7 According to Asconius (85, and 89 C) Catiline became governor of Africa ex practura, and after his term returned to Rome in time to present himself as a candidate for the consulship of 65.

   8 This list of at least nine, and perhaps all ten, of the Tribunes of this year is secured by combining the three names preserved in the prescript of the Lex Antonia with the names preserved in CIL 12.2.744, where all or part of all ten names appears. They are all names of Tribunes (see commentary in CIL), except perhaps the fragmentary name of a Curator Viarum, which comes last in the list above. Caesar, probably before his aedileship (Plut. Caes. 5.5), and Minucius Thermus, when a candidate for the consulship undertook curatorships, Caesar of the Appian, and Minucius of the Flaminian, way (Cic. Att. 1.1.2). Volcatius therefore, if his name is correctly restored, could possibly be the Consul of 66. Mommsen however has shown that the Tribunes were concerned with public works in the city (Ges. Schr. 3.27 ff., and comm. on CIL 12.2.744), and interprets no. 751 on the builder of the Pens Fabricius to mean that Fabricius as Curator Viarum was at the same time one of the Tribunes (62 B. C.). The date of this college of Tribunes remains not altogether certain. It is of necessity later than the date mentioned in the Lex Antonia (Apr. 1, 72), and cannot be placed in 69 (see 69, Tribunes), or in the years of the tribunates of Plautius (see 70), or of Lollius Palicanus (see 71). Mommsen's suggestion of 72 would be possible if Tribunes at that time had the right to propose legislation, but Mommsen's chief evidence that they had this right, contrary to what both Cicero (Leg. 3.2.2) and Caesar (BC 1.7.3) imply, seems to be this very law (Str. 2.312, note 1, and 3.158). The law therefore is probably subsequent to the restoration of the powers of the tribunate. By elimination 68 appears to be the most probable year. The date in 72 chosen as a point of reference in the law for the regulation of arrangements with Termessus must be based on a situation in Asia or in Termessus itself during the Third Mithridatic War. Note also that a date in 68 probably reveals a stage in the career of Antonius after his expulsion from the Senate in 70. On the Lex Antonia, see Magic, Roman Rule in Asia Minor, 1.295; 2.1176f., note 34. 
  </footnote>
  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark260a">
   9 The precise order of the governors of Asia between the decision to end the command of Lucullus in 69 and the arrival of P. Orbius in 64 remains uncertain. Dolabella was the Praetor in charge of the trial of Caecina in 69 or 68 (see 69, Praetors), and was therefore Proconsul of Asia in 68 or 67. L. Manlius Torquatus, whose title, though not his province, is attested by an inscription of Miletus (Wiegand, 6 vorläufiger Bericht, APAW 1908, Anhang 20), held the consulship in 65, and his praetorship may tentatively be dated in 68, and his proconsulship (almost certainly in Asia) in 67, since he was not likely to be delayed in his career. Dolabella may then be placed in Asia in 68. For the remaining two years we have T. Aufidius and P. Varinius. Their dates are not independently attested but they did follow immediately in this order (Cic. Flacc. 45). If Aufidius is the possible candidate named by Cicero (Att. 1.1.1) for the consulship of 63, his praetorship should be dated in 66 and his command in Asia in 65. Lange (3.185, and 206) held that Varinius proceeded to Asia in 72 after his praetorship and defeat at the hands of Spartacus and that Lucullus became governor of Asia only in 71. It seems more probable that Lucullus held Asia from the beginning of 73 at the latest (see 74, Promagistrates, on Lucullus; and Addendum). Reasons for the interval in the case of Varinius are not given, but the career of C. Antonius after his expulsion from the Senate in 70 affords a possible parallel, and suggests that Varinius repeated his career to the praetorship in 66 . There is no evidence that Q. Voconius Naso (Iudex Quaestionis in 66, and Praetor sometime before 60) was ever a governor of Asia at all. See Broughton, TAPhA 79 (1948) 67-72, with criticism of the lists of Chapot and Waddington; Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor 2.1127f., note 47.

As Flaminius and Plaetorius were then in charge of the Quaestio de sicariis it is probable that, like Caesar in 64, they held the office of Iudex Quaestionis in the year following their aedileship. Accordingly, I place their aedileship and the praetorship of lunius and Publicius in 67 (see Wehrmann, FP 48, note; and Münzer, RE, Flaminius no. 4). Sydenham (lxiv) dates Plaetorius in 68.

Cato was serving as a Tribune of the Soldiers in Macedonia (see above), the sons of Pompey were still too young for command, and Caepio has been confused either with Cato's half-brother who died while on his way to Asia (see Plut. Cat. Min. 11, and 15.4), or else with Servilius, Pompey's admiral in the Euxine in 65 (Plut. Pomp. 34.5; cf. Dio 37.3.2-3; see Groebe, Klio 10 [1910] 382).

   12 Zumpt (Comm. Epig. 2.184-186) identifies this Rubrius with the L. Culleolus, Proconsul, probably of Macedonia (Byllis was situated in his province), to whom Cicero addressed Fam. 13.41 and 42, and this identification was accepted by Gäbler in his list of the governors of Macedonia (RE 14.765). Münzer (RE, as above, and 4.1295, and 1744) shows that it is unwarranted, quite apart from the improbability that any letters in the Ad Familiares should be dated so early. Cato's military tribunate under Rubrius (see below) was contemporary with commands both of Lucullus and Pompey (Plut. Cat. Min. 10.2), and the trip of his half-brother Caepio to Asia, on which he died, may well have been undertaken for service under Pompey (ibid. 11). The probable date is therefore 67 and 66 and cannot be much later, for Cato returned to Rome and was elected Quaestor for 64 (see 64, Quaestors) at the latest.

   15 Under the Gabinian law Pompey was entitled to appoint Legates with praetorian imperium (App. Mith. 94; cf. SIG³ 750; Plut. Pomp. 26) to the number, according to Plutarch, of 15 (Pomp. 25; cf. Dio 36.37), according to Appian (Mith. 94), of 24; of that number we have the names of the 15 listed above, 13 of whom held command each in one of the 13 special areas designated by Pompey (see Zonar. 10.3). Their appointment may well have been extended in a number of cases with the extension of the term of Pompey's command under the Manilian law. At any rate Gellius was still in command of a fleet in 63 (Cic. P. Red. ad Quir. 17). See Mommsen, Str. 2.656, note 2; Th. Reinach, RPh 14 (1890) 150. On his Legates and plan of campaign, see P. Groebe, Klio 10 (1910) 374-389; H. A. Ormerod, Liverpool Annals of Art and Archaeology 10 (1923) 46-51.

   16 Groebe identified this Legate, whose praenomen is not given in Appian and Florus, with L. Manlius Torquatus, Consul in 65 (Klio 10 [19101381). This he did without taking account of an inscription found at Miletus (APAW 1908, 6 vorläuf. Bericht, Anhang 20) in which there is named an L. Manlius Torquatus who may reasonably be identified with the Proquaestor of 81 (see 81, Promagistrates) and the Consul of 65. Münzer (RE no. 76) has shown that A. Manlius A. f., Quaestor in 81, and governor of Africa before 68 (Cic. Planc. 27), would more probably be assigned a western command. Could L. Manlius Torquatus, who served in the East under Sulla and became Proconsul of Asia (see Promagistrates), possibly have been a Legate of Pompey before assuming his provincial command in the course of the summer at the end of hostilities in the war with the pirates (Cic. Leg. Man. 35)? Such a situation would explain his anomalous title #, Legatus pro consule.

  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark278">
   17 Gelenius substituted the reading # for the Mss reading #, but Groebe is inclined to delete it as merely a repetition of the cognomen of the following name Terentius Varro, and identify the Plotius of Appian and Florus with Plautius or Plotius, who was Aedile along with Plancius in 54 and Praetor in 51 (Klio 10 [1910] 381), and distinguish him from P. Plautius Hypsaeus, who as Pompey's Quaestor in 64 could hardly have been Legatus pro praetore in 67.

   3 If this Flaccus is the Praetor of 63 and Proconsul in Asia of 62 it is surprising that Cicero makes no mention of his service with Pompey in t he Pro Flacco (see Groebe, Klio 10 [1910] 383, note 3; Th. Reinach, Mith. Eupator [ed. Goetz] 384, note 1). A passage in Cicero (Flacc. 6, bellum Cretense ex magna parte gessit) suggests that he did not remain with Metellus throughout the war, and hence may have joined Pompey when hostilities in Crete were nearing an end. 4 That these Legates continued in command for at least three years, and probably more, is indicated by the term of command of Gellius over his fleet (Cic. P. Red. ad Quir. 17, referring almost certainly to 63).

   4 It is not certain that the Lex Fabia was a tribunician bill. Niccolini (FTP 266) suggests a date in 64 because the Comm. Pet. (37), which was composed early in that year, makes no mention of the limitation.

   5 According to Drumann-Groebe (4.165-169) Cato's quaestorship should be dated in 65, and he made two trips to Asia, one before and one after his quaestorship. According to Plutarch (Cat. Min. 10-18, esp. 11.1, and 12.2) his first trip was a brief sojourn in Asia during his military tribunate in Macedonia, and his second, during which he travelled as far as Antioch, was subsequent to his military tribunate but before his return to run for office in Rome. This is supported by the fact that he waited until his return from his second trip to bring home the ashes of his half-brother Caepio. The first difficulty arises from Plutarch's statement that he met Pompey at Ephesus, and the second from the story of his reception at Antioch (cf. Plut. Pomp. 40). Pompey's presence at Ephesus is not attested until 62, when Cato was a Tribune of the Plebs in Rome. Pompey was in Pamphylia in late 67 when envoys came to him from the cities of Crete (Cic. Leg. Man. 35), and at some time in 66 apparently moved from Cilicia into Galatia and Pontus when given command against Mithridates (App. Mith. 97). As he had troops operating in Asia also (Cic. Leg. Man. 39) there is no reason why he might not have been in Ephesus at some intervening period. A moment early in his campaign is indicated, for he was eagerly collectii3,g young officers for his service (cf. Plut. Cat. Min. 14.3). The second point creates no difficulty, for it is now known that Marcius Rex reached Antioch in 67 or 66 (see 67, Promagistrates; G. Downey, CPh 32 [1937] 144-151), and therefore Cato's visit to Antioch can be earlier than 64. Furthermore, a date in 64 for his quaestorship accords better with the legal age for this magistracy in the post- Sullan period. The evidence for the date of his birth points to 95 B. C. (Plut. Cat. Min. 3, and 73; Liv. Per. 114). If he attained the quaestorship at the same age as Cicero, the most probable year is 64. See Mommsen, Str. 1.567-571.

   7 It is possible that Damascus was occupied before 64, or at any rate that Pompey's Legates and other officers were active in Syria soon after Pompey took command from Marcius Rex in 66. Josephus seems to place the beginning of the intervention of Scaurus in Jewish affairs at about this time (see 66, Quaestors; and references above). If some time be allowed for the development of the situation in Judaea after the death of Queen Alexandra in 67, the events referred to above may with probability be dated in 65 or early 64, just before Pompey's arrival in Syria.

   3 Dio places Caesar's election in 63, but is manifestly incorrect in dating it after the death of the conspirators (see Sall. Cat. 49). Mention of the Lex Domitia and of the procedure for the election of the Pontifex Maximus in the speech against the Law of Rullus (Lex Agr. 2.18-19) is no indication that Metellus' death and Caesar's election occurred early in the year, since the form of that election was probably not changed by the laws of Domitius or Sulla or Labienus (L.R. Taylor, CPh 37 [1942] 421-424). Metellus Pius is last mentioned directly in connection with the trial of Cornelius in 65 (Ascon. 60 and 79 C; Val. Max. 8.5.4).

   2 Three inscriptions from Magnesia on the Maeander (I. v. Magn. 144-146) name a Proconsul #), L. Valerius L. f. Flaccus, who was married to a daughter of L. Saufeius, and had a daughter named Valeria Paulla. His mother, Baebia, is also honored. He may be identified with either the elder Flaccus (Consul 86), or the governor of 62 (see Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor 2.1242, note 1). If the younger Flaccus is meant the title may be an error since Cicero repeatedly refers to him as Praetor. Saufeius, a contemporary of Atticus and Cicero, might have had a daughter old enough in 62 to be married to Flaccus and have a daughter of her own. This Paulla Valeria should be distinguished from the sister of Valerius Triarius, who bore the same name (Cic. Fam. 8.7.2).

Att. 1.20.3; Dio 37.46.3-4), and of their successors, are based on the order of the lists of priests in Macrob. Sat. 3.13.11 (before 6913.C.) and in Cicero (Har. Resp. 12; Dom. 118; in 57 B.C.),

   4 Seidel (FA 62) suggests 59 as an approximate date. Varro's career (Tr. Mil. 79, Q. before 73, Tr. Pl. perhaps by 68) favors an earlier date for his aedileship, but if Murena was a younger brother of the Consul of 62 Seidel's conjecture is probable.

   5 The reference in Cicero shows that at the end of 60 Nigidius was in a position such that he could cite (compellare) jurymen, and did so in reference to the trial of C. Antonius. Münzer (RE) suggests that he held the aedileship in 60, Niccolini (FTP 281) that he was a Tribune of the Plebs in 59. He was a member of the Senate in 63 (Cic. Sull. 42; Suet. Aug. 94.5; Plut.

     The following men held provincial governorships immediately after the passage in 52 of the Pompeian law which established an interval between the praetorship or consulship and a provincial command, and may therefore have held the praetorship before 57 (all the Praetors of 57 are known). It is however more probable that the law did not apply to magistrates in office in 53 and 52 (see 54, Praetors), hence these dates remain only as possibilities.

   1 Münzer (Hermes 40 [1905] 94-99) explains the delay of six years in the celebration of the games for Metellus by assuming that Metellus Scipio waited to give them as Aedile (cf. Caesar's games in 65 in honor of his father), and notes his association in office, distinction, and ancestry with Fabius Maximus. Both men appear to be mentioned in Antoine de la Sale's quotations from Cicero's Do Virtutibus (F. Gustafisson, BPhW 24 [1904] 1278f.). Münzer (RE Supb. 3.223, on no. 99) also cites Knoellinger, Cicero, De Virt. 28, 10ff., and 49f., which I have not seen.

   2 The name of this law shows that it is not identical with Caesar's Lex Agraria, despite the identity of certain clauses as quoted by Callistratus in Dig. 47.21.3 (Fabricius, SBAH 1924-1925, Abh. 1, 11-15; identified by Rudorff, and after him by Mommsen, Ges. Schr. 5.200f.). But that same identity indicates a date in the Caesarian period and a connection with his program. Moreover, several of the names mentioned belong to persons who were prominent in this period (see above, on Roscius and Allienus). A date between 59 and 56 is excluded because the names of the Tribunes known in each of these years do not leave room for this group of five. This year on the other hand is appropriate since Pompey and Crassus were in command of the government in Rome, there are vacant places on the list for these Tribunes, and the interval between this year and that of the praetorships of Roscius and Allienus is a normal one. The Fabius who was Tribune this year and a Legate under Caesar thereafter should be distinguished from the Praetor of 57. It is probable that the law was passed to regulate problems that had arisen in the formation of municipalities and the regulation of their land as the commissioners under the Lex Agraria of Caesar continued their task. They were probably active through much of this decade, as there was still some land undistributed in 50 (Cael. in Cic. Fam. 8.10.4). See Rudolph, Stadt und Staat im römischen Italien 186ff., esp. 196-198; rev. by H. S. Jones, JRS 26 (1936) 270f.; L. R. Taylor, Studies Presented to Professor A. C. Johnson pp. 68-78; on the Lex Mamilia of 109, see 109, Tribunes of the Plebs, and note 2.

     Domitius continued in strong opposition to the Triumvirate and their henchmen, against Caesar (Suet. Nero 2.2, cf. Iul. 24), against Gabinius (Cic. QF 2.11.2; Dio 39.60.3-4), and even opposed burial honors for Iulia (Dio 39.64). Claudius became reconciled with Cicero (Fam. 1.9.4 and 19; 3.10.8 and 10; QF 2.10.1-3; Scaur. 31-37), first aided Gabinius by using comitial days to delay the proceedings against him (Cic. QF 2.11.3), then attacked him (QF 3.2.3; Dio 39.60.3-4), aided Pomptinus at last to obtain his triumph (see Promagistrates), served along with a commission of ten Legates to settle disputes between Interamna and Reate (Varro RR 3.2.3; cf. Cic. Scaur. 27; Att. 4.15.5), and vowed a propylon to Demeter at Eleusis (CIL 12 .2.775). Both Consuls were involved in the election scandal of this year (Cic. Att. 4.15.7, and 17.2; cf. QF 3.1.16, and 2.3, and 3.2). Claudius proceeded to his province of Cilicia, probably without the benefit of a Lex curiata de imperio (Cic. Att. 4.18.4; Fam. 1.9.25; QF 3.2.3).

  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark327">
   1 A broken inscription, found in Athens (Arch. Delt. 1889, 133, no. 13) records honors for a Proconsul whose name and title appear as #[# or 3 letters] #. The inscription has been variously dated, but recently Broneer (AJA 36 [1932] 394f.) has with great probability placed it in the middle of the first century B. C. Lolling in the original publication supplied the name Paconius. Broneer associates it with a certain C. Horconius or Orconius, who was honored at Delphi, but without titles, in an inscription of this general period (Colin, Fouilles de Delphes 3.4, p. 70, no. 46). Both these names and others suggested by Broneer, such as Holconius (loc. cit.), suffer from the objection that no persons of these names were at all prominent in office under the Roman Republic, so far as we know, or were likely to have advanced as far as the proconsulate of Macedonia. 1 wish to suggest the name of C. Cosconius, who was an Aedile of the Plebs in 57 and belonged to a praetorian family (see Index). The normal course of his career would have brought him to the praetorship about 54 and made him eligible for a provincial command about 53, precisely the year in this period in which there is a gap in the known list of governors of Macedonia. Probably the praetorius who was killed by Caesar's mutinous troops in 47 (see 48, Praetors).

   1 M. Nonius Sufenas was governor of an eastern province in Feb. 50 (Cic. Att. 6.1.13) and very probably in 51. As he held the quaestorship in 62 and the tribunate of the Plebs in 56, Pompey's law establishing an interval of five years between city magistracy and provincial command can hardly have been applied to him. In fact, it may not have been applied to the magistrates of 52 at all. Accordingly 1 suggest 52 as the year of his praetorship and 51 and 50 for his promagistracy.

   2 Plutarch (Cat. Min. 46-47) appears to place Favonius' aedileship before the electoral violence of late 53 and early 52, but also associates his games with those of Curio (whom he terms a colleague), who was absent from Rome in 53 and gave his games in honor of his father in 52 (Cic. Fam. 2.3; Plin. NH 36.116-120). Curio was not then an Aedile but was preparing for his candidacy for the aedileship of 50. Dio places Favonius' aedileship during the tribunate of Pompeius Rufus, which is dated in 52 (see Tribunes of the Plebs). Favonius was an unsuccessful candidate for the praetorship of 50 (Cael. in Cic. Fam. 8.9.5).

   3 Since Considius presided over a trial organized under one of the older laws he may be one of the Praetors of this year (Mommsen, Strafrecht 208, note 1), though it is not certain how regularly Praetors conducted trials under the Lex Plautia de vi. If Pompey's law regarding provincial commands applied to the magistrates of 52 it becomes difficult to identify Considius with either C. Considius Longus (RE no. 11), who was governor of Africa in or before 51 (see 5 1, Promagistrates), or M. Considius Nonianus (RE no. 13), who was assigned Cisalpine Gaul in succession to Caesar in 49. If he was not a Praetor of this year either of the above persons might have served. Mommsen wished to identify him with C. Considius Nonianus who issued coins in 54 (RE no. 12; 62 B. C., Grueber, CRRBM 1.473f.), Willems (1.512) with M. Considius Nonianus.

   2 On the evidence of Cicero (De Or. 3.228) who describes Hortensius as a sodalis of the orator Grassus, it is supposed that he became an Augur before 91 B. C. However, collega seems to be the usual term to describe a fellow-augur and sodalis refers to other societies like the Luperci, or merely to clubs (Cic. Cael 26; cf. Q. Cic. Comm. Pet. 19). Varro and Pliny (locc. citt.) prove that he becam, an Augur considerably before 67.

     In this year Caesar brought an army across the Adriatic, and after winter engagements, such as his attempt to besiege Pompey at Dyrrachium, won a decisive victory over Pompey at Pharsalus, then pursued him to Egypt, and toward the end of the year became embroiled in the dispute between Cleopatra and her brother for the

   1 The date is based on a calculation of the time necessary for news of the victory at Pharsalus to reach Rome and news of the action of Servilius in turn to reach Alexandria. In any case Antony was exercising the office of Master of Horse in December (Cic. Att. 11.7.2). Plutarch and Dio state that Caesar's dictatorship was annual, and Plutarch (Caes. 51.1) that he returned from the East at the close of his year, i. e. in September 47. As he was termed Dictator iterum in 46 (Grueber, CRRBM 2.576) and did not enter upon his third dictatorship until April of that year, Mommsen believed that his dictatorship, like that of Sulla, was of indefinite duration, and not rei gerendae; but rei publicae. constitutendae causa (CIL 12.1, 41). But some of his coins bear the inscription Cos. ter without mention of the dictatorship (Grueber CRRBM 1.525f.), hence there was probably an interval between the second and the third dictatorship, and the office itself was probably assumed rei gerendae rather than rei publicae constituendae coma (see Degrassi 132f., where earlier literature is summarized). This dictatorship is listed under 47 in Fast. Cap.

   3 Mommsen (CIL 12.2.604) and Lange (RA 2.687; 4.455) assign this bill to the praetorship of Hirtius in 46, perhaps correctly, since no other te xt implies that Hirtius held the tribunate, but Niccolini (FTP 335ff.) uses the passage of Dio to date it in 48, and points out that the presence of Hirtius in Spain in 49 (Cic. Att. 10.4.6 and 11), and at Antiocheia in 47 (11.14.3, and 20. 1) does not preclude him from being a Tribune of the Plebs in Rome in 48.

   8 The praenomen is probably Marcus rather than Manius, see Boissevain on Dio 42.12. 1. The readings in the Mss of Caesar in the passages cited support this view, perhaps also the inscription on a coin of Panormus (Bull. Inst. Arch. Rome 1834, 74, M. ACIL.), if he is the person named. He is probably to be identified with the Marcus Acilius (text reading Aemilius) who held command of legions in Greece in 45 (Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 16, FGrH 2A.398, line 20). Grant (From Imperium to Auctoritas 17) holds that the Proconsul in Sicily was named Manius Acilius, but that the commander of the legions in Greece in 45-44 was Marcus Acilius, the future Consul Suffectus of 33, and identifies him with an unnamed Quaestor pro praetore in Macedonia in this period. The cognomen appears in the Mss of Caesar BC 3.39. 1, and the combination M. Acilius Caninus in ILS 892.

     2. provision that juries should consist only of senators and knights (Suet. Iul. 41.2; Dio 43.25.1; cf. Cic.

Phil. 1.19; see Sternkopf, Hermes 57 [1912] 321-349); 4. abolition of collegia, except those of ancient foundation (Suet. Iul. 42.3; cf. on his favors to the Jews, Joseph. AJ 14.213ff., esp. 215);
    </ref>
    <ref>
     5. persons condemned de vi and de maiestate were to be interdicted from fire and water (Cic. Phil. 1.23); 6. sumptuary laws which limited the expenses of banquets, the use of litters, etc. (Cic. Fam. 9.25.5, and 26.4; Suet. Iul. 43; Dio 43.25.2; Jerome, Chr. ad ann. 46, p. 156 Helm); 7. prizes for large families (Dio 43.25.2); 8. Cleopatra of Egypt was made a friend and ally of Rome (Dio 43.27.3; cf. App. BC 2.102). He also advanced large building enterprises, such as the Basilica Iulia and the Iulian Forum (Res Gest. D. Aug. 20; Plin. NH 36.103; Plut. Caes. 29.3; Dio 43.22.2-3, the dedication of the Forum and the Temple of Venus Genetrix), reduced the number of recipients of public grain (Suet. Iul. 41.3; cf. Plut. Caes. 55.3; App. BC 2.102; Dio 43.21.4), and carried on through this year and until his death a huge program of colonization and settlement of veterans, as well as colonization of the poor of the city (Suet.

     After his success in the African campaign, Caesar was named Dictator, probably late in April, for a period of ten years (Dio 43.14.3), in succession, presumably for the third time for one year and designated for each of the next nine, and rei gerendae rather than rei publicae constituendae causa (see Degrassi 133; and note Bell. Hisp. 2.1, Caesar dictator tertio, designatus dictator quarto, and Grueber, CRRBM 2.576, Dict. iter., Cos. tert., and 1.357ff., Dict. ter., and the notice of his third dictatorship in Fast. Cap. for 45, Degrassi 56f., 133, 500f.). He also received the cura morum (Dio 43.14.4; cf. Cic. Fam. 9.15.5, and 26.3; Att. 12.35; 13.6.1, and 7.1; Sall. Ad Caes. 1.5-8; Suet. Iul. 43).

     Caesar's third dictatorship continued until April, 45, and was immediately followed by his fourth, which in turn continued until he became Dictator for life at some time between January 26 and February 15, 44 (Grueber, CRRBM 1.537-539, Dict. ter., in the term of the Prefect Plancus, and 542-544, Dict. quar.; Fast. Cap., Degrassi 56f., 133, 500f.; Fast. Amer., ibid. 242; Fast. Colot., ibid. 274; Bell. Hisp. 2, dictator tertio designatus dictator quarto; cf. IGRP 4.33b; CIL 12.2.788; Tac. Hist. 3.37; Dio 43, Index, and 14.4, Dictator for two successive years; and on the duration of the fourth dictatorship, see 44, Dictator, and esp. Degrassi 133f.). His Spanish campaign ended in a final victory at Munda over the Pompeian forces (Bell. Hisp.), and he was saluted as Imperator at Ategua (Bell. Hisp. 19.6; cf. Cic. Fam. 13.15, prescript, and cf. 16), a title which the Senate later decreed should be permanent (Dio 43.44.2; cf. Grueber, CRRBM 1.544f.). He celebrated a triumph for his victory in early October (Liv. Per. 116; Vell. 2.56.2; Suet. Iul. 37.1; Plin. NH 14.97; Quintil. Inst. Or. 6.3.61; Plut. Caes. 56.4; Flor. 2.13.88-89; Dio 43.42.1).

Various measures, some of which may have been promulgated in 46, involved a large increase in the membership of the Senate (Cic. Fam. 6.18.1; Phil. 11.12; 13.27; Suet. Iul. 76.3; 80.2; Dio 43.47.3), additions to the numbers of the regular annual magistrates, fourteen Praetors in 45 and sixteen in 44, increase of the Aediles to six, through the creation of the Aediles Ceriales, and the election of forty Quaestors in 45 (Dio 43.47.2, and 49.1, and 51.3-4). He created new patrician families (Suet. Iul. 41.1), and extended the pomerium (Dio 43.50.1). He provided that citizens between the ages of twenty and forty must not remain outside of Italy more then three successive years (Suet. Iul. 42. 1), and no son of a senator unless he served on an administrative staff (ibid.). He revived customs dues in Italy (Suet. Iul. 43.1), and provided that grazers must employ freemen up to at least one-third of their herdsmen (Suet. Iul. 42.2).

Their insignia included the lictors, dress, and curule chair, like those of the Master of Horse. Two of them took charge of finances, since no Quaestors had been elected, and others performed the duties of the Curule Aediles. They were not replaced by elected magistrates until after Caesar's return from Spain. Of these Prefects we know the name of the following:

     As Caesar's colleague Antony carried at least two of the many measures in his honor, one to change the name of the month Quinctilis to Iulius i(Macrob. 1.12.34; Jerome Chr. ad ann. 45, p. 157 Helm; Suet. Iul. 76.1; Censorin.

    </ref>
    <ref>
     for his eastern campaign (Cic. Phil. 1.31; 2.79 and 82-83 and 88 and 99; 3.9; 5.9; Plut. Ant. 11.2-3; Caes. 62.5;
    </ref>
    <ref>
     Die 43.51.8). At the celebration of the Lupercalia he offered Caesar a crown (Cic. Phil. 2.8"7; 3.12; 13.17 and 31 and 41; Quintil. Inst. Or. 9.3.61; Plut. Ant. 12; Caes. 61; App. BC 2.109; Die 44:.11; 45.30; cf. Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 21, FGrH 2A.405, who names Licinius as the one who made the offer first). On the Ides of March Trebonius drew him away from the scene of the assassination (Cic. Phil. 13.22; Vell. 2.58; Plut. Brut. 17.1, and 18; Ant. 13; Caes. 66.3; App. BC 2.117; Dio 44.19.1-3). He fled, but later, with the backing of Lepidus and his troops (see Master of Horse, and Promagistrates), recovered himself, secured possession of Caesar's papers and his treasury, and used a period of accommodation with the Liberators and the help of Caesar's veterans to become master of the situation in Rome. Brutus and Cassius were driven out of the capital and received commands (see below, Praetors), and other Liberators succeeded to commands which had been assigned to them by Caesar (see Promagistrates), while Antony himself gained command of Macedonia (and Dolabella of Syria) in April (Cic. Att. 14.9.3, and 14.4; Die 45.15.2; 47.29.1; cf. App. BC 3.8, and 12, and 24, and 27; 4.57; Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 30; see Holmes Architect 188-190) and of Caesar's army there, and then early in June secured by plebiscite the Gallic provinces instead, while both he and Dolabella were confirmed in their commands for five years (Cic. Phil. 1.19 and 25; 2.6 and 109; 5.7-8; 8.28; Att. 15.11.4; Liv. Per. 11-7; Vell. 2.60.5; App. BC

    <ref>
     Within this period after the Ides of March several other pieces of legislation were carried: a Lex Antonia to confirm Caesar's acts (Cic. Phil. 1.16-24; 2.100; 5.8 and 10; 6.3; 10.17; 13.31; Fam. 12.4.6; Att. 14.9.2, and 12.1;
    </ref>
    <ref>
     App. BC 2.135; 3.5, and 22; Dio 44.53.2; 45.23), and another abolishing the dictatorship (Cic. Phil. 1.3; 2.91; Liv. Per. 116; App. BC 3.25; Dio 44.51.2), and with his colleague Dolabella one making fresh assignments of
    </ref>
    <ref>
     land to veterans (Cic. Phil. 5. 10; cf. 2. 100 and 112; Att. 14.7.2; App. BC 3.57). A Lex Antonia added a third
    </ref>
    <ref>
     panel to the juries, one of centurions without census rating (Cic. Phil. 1.19-20; 5.8; 13.3 and 5), while another permitted appeal by persons condemned in the quaestiones perpetuae de vi and de maiestate (Cic. Phil. 1.21; cf. 13.5; Dio 46.36.2). In addition there was a large amount of legislation for which Antony claimed the authority of Caesar's acta one to recall exiles (Cic. Phil. 2.98; 5.11; Dio 45.25.2; 46.15.2), one to grant full Roman citizenship to all of Sicily (Cic. Att. 14.12.1; Phil. 1.24; 2.92; 3.30; 5.12; 7.15), one to restore Deiotarus of Galatia to his full rights as King in Galatia (Cic. Phil. 2.93-94; Att. 14.12.1, and 19.2), and one to relieve the island of Crete of vectigalia, and make it no longer a province after Brutus' governorship (Cic. Phil. 2.97; Dio 45.32.4; 46.23.3). Meantime, rising support for Caesar's heir, the young Octavian, and the growth of opposition to Antony among the moderate Caesarians led by Hirtius and Pansa caused him increasing difficulty, which was augmented when two of his legions on their way from Macedonia to attack Decimus Brutus in Cisalpine Gaul deserted to Octavian. Toward the end of the year he entered Cisalpine Gaul. to enforce his claim to that province against the Proconsul Decimus Brutus, who insisted that he was remaining as the legitimate governor.

     Caesar chose Dolabella with the intention that when he should depart for the Parthian war Dolabella should

     become Consul in his place (Cic. Phil. 2.79-80; Vell. 2.58.3; Plut. Ant. 11.2; App. BC 2.122; Dio 43.51.8), but Antony opposed the election (Cic. Phil. 1.31; 2.79 and 82-83 and 88 and 99; 3.9; 5.9; Plut. Ant. 11.2-3; Caes. 62.5). Dolabella however used the occasion of Caesar's assassination to secure the consent of both the Liberators and Antony to his succession (Cic. Phil. 1.5 and 31; 3.9; 5.9; Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 28, FGrH 2A.413; Vell. 2.58.3, and 60.4; App. BC 2.122; Dio 44.22.1, and 51.2; Jerome Chr. ad ann. 44, p. 157 Helm; Zonar. 10.12). He probably joined Antony in carrying in April a law for the settlement of veterans (Cic. Phil. 5. 10-11). In the same month during Antony's absence from Rome he suppressed a worship of Caesar and destroyed a pillar that had been erected where the body had been burned (Cic. Att. 14.20.2 and 4, and 15.1, and 16.2, and 19.4; Fam. 9.14.7; cf. Phil. 1.5 and 30; 2.107; Dio 44.51.2; Lactant. Inst. Div. 1.15). In the reallotment of consular provinces

     in April he received Syria (Cic. Att. 14.9.3, and 14.4; App. BC 3.7-8, and 12, and 24, and 27; 4.57; Dio 45.15.2; 47.29.1; cf. Cic. Phil. 11.4 and 28; see above, on Antony; and below, Legates, on Cicero). Soon after presiding over the meeting of the Senate on September 2 (Cic. Phil. 1.27) he prepared to depart for his province, and though still at Formiae on October 25 (Cic. Att. 15.13.5) returned no more to Rome. He was still Consul when he passed through Macedonia and took with him one legion from Caesar's former army there, and perhaps reached Asia by the end of the year (Cic.

     Caesar was still Dictator for the fourth time at the beginning of the year, but he became Dictator Perpetuus at some time after January 26, when he celebrated an ovatio as Dictator IIII, and February 15 (Fast.

     The excessive honors, including deification (see esp. Cic. Phil. 2.110; 13.41; Dio 44.6.4), which were paid to Caesar in the last months of his life included a prefectship of public morals for life (Suet. Iul. 76.1; Dio 44.5.3; Zonar. 10.12), provision that magistrates should swear to uphold the validity of his acts (App. BC 2.106), an oath, taken by all the senators, to protect his person (Suet.

Phil. 13.23; Dio 44.4.4; see Grueber, CRRBM 1.549, 552), the naming of the month of July in his honor (see above, on Antony), provision that his son should be Pontifex Maximus (Liv. Per. 116; App. BC 2.106; Dio 44.5.3), the right to a gilded chair and triumphal robe and a laurel crown on public occasions (Cic. Div. 1.119; Nic. Dam. Vit. Aug. 21, FGrH 2A.405; Val.

     Lepidus held this office during both Caesar's fourth dictatorship and his dictatorship for life (see 45, Master of Horse; Fast. Cap., Degrassi 58f., 134, 500f.; Fast. Amer., ibid. 242; Fast.

He protested against Antony's offer of a crown to Caesar at the Lupercalia (Cic. Phil. 5.38; 13.17). In office at the time of Caesar's death, he effectively turned the situation in Antony's favor during the next few days (Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 27, FGrH 2A.411f.; Plut.

Although he shared in the amnesty accorded to the Liberators, the revulsion of feeling in Rome and the rise of Antony compelled both him and Brutus to withdraw from the city early in April (App. BC 2.148; 3.2; 4.57; Dio47.20; cf. Cic .Att. 14.5.1, and 7.1; Plut. Brut. 21; Cic. 42.3; Ant.15.1; cf. Caes. 68). He remained for some months in Latium and Campania collecting a fleet, ostensibly in connection with his appointment to charge of the grain collection by the Senate on June 5 (Cic. Att. 14.4. 1, and 10.1; 15.4.2, and esp. 9.1, Sicily, and 11.1-2, and 12.1, and 20.2; 16.2.4, and 3.6; Fam. 12.2, away in September). Later in the summer he was assigned the province of Cyrene, perhaps about August 1 (Plut. Brut. 19.3; App. BC 3.8, Cyrenaica and Crete; cf. Phil. 2.31 and 97, on the date; Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 28, FGrH 2A.414, Illyricum; Dio 47.21.1, Bithynia; see T. Rice Holmes, Architect of the Roman Empire 196f.). He joined Brutus in issuing an edict in sharp criticism of Antony (Cic. Fam. 12.3; cf. Att. 16.7.1 and 7; Vell. 2.62.3), and about the end of September departed for the East, and proceeded, not to the province assigned him, but by way of Asia (Cic. Fam. 12.14.6; Dio 47.26.1-2) to Syria (Cic. Phil. 11.27-28; Vell. 2.62.2; Dio 47.20-21; cf. Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 28, and 31, FGrH 2A.413f., 419f.).

     Though probably not one of the conspirators (despite Plut.

Max. 9.9.1; Suet. Iul. 85; Plut. Brut. 18.6-7; 20.5-6; App. BC 2.121), but when he resumed them for the Senate meeting of March 17 he required the protection of Lepidus (App. BC 2.126, cf. 137). He became such an object of hatred to the crowd at Caesar's funeral that they killed a Tribune named Cinna by mistake for him (see Tribunes of the Plebs). He sponsored the recall of Caesetius and Marullus (see Tribunes of the Plebs; Nic. Dam. Vit. Caes. 22, FGrH 2A.406) after Caesar's death, and in the Senate meeting on November 28 refused to share in the allotment of provinces (Cic. Phil. 3.25).

Att. 16.7, at Velia on August 17; Phil. 1.8-10; 10.8; Ad Brut. 1. 10.4, and 15.5), proceeded to Athens and moved on Macedonia toward the end of the yeaT, probably upon Pansa left Rome about March 19, intending to join Hirtius in Cisalpine Gaul, but Antony's attempt to surprise him led first to a defeat for Pansa's army of recruits, and then to a serious reverse at Forum Gallorum for Antony himself at the hands of Hirtius and Octavian (Cic. Fam. 10.30, and 33.3-4; Ad Brut. 1.3a; Phil. 14.26-27 and 36-37; Liv. Per. 119; Frontin. Str. 2.5.39; Suet. Aug. 10.3; Plut.

All three commanders were acclaimed Imperatores, and in Rome the Senate voted a supplicatio, and a memorial to the fallen (Cic.

In a second battle at Mutina on April 21 Hirtius and Octavian again defeated Antony, who raised the siege of Mutina and retreated hastily to the west, but Hirtius fell in the battle, and Pansa died shortly afterwards (April 23) of wounds received at Forum Gallorum (Cic.

     with and in general taking superior command over the forces of Octavian, yet still attempting to leave some opening for a settlement with Antony (Cic.

     Meantime Pansa was active in raising levies, and continued in charge of business in Rome. Upon the abrogation of much of the Antonian legislation (Cic. Phil. 5. 10; 10. 17, and on the Lex Antonia Agraria, see Phil. 6.14; 11.13), Pansa carried fresh measures to confirm the veteran colonies (Cic. Phil. 13.31), and probably also
    </ref>
    <ref>
     measures to confirm Caesar's acts and to abolish the office of Dictator (Phil. 5.10; 10.17). He presided over the

     various debates regarding Antony's status, the legitimizing of the command of Brutus in Macedonia, the recognition of Sextus Pompey, and the command against Dolabella in Asia and Syria (in the latter case his own expectation of a province brought him into conflict with Cicero's proposal of a nwius imperium for Cassius) (Cic.

     The development of the situation after the death of the two Consuls led Octavian in August to send a deputation of soldiers to demand election to the consulship for him and later to march on Rome at the head of his army. On August 19 he was elected to the consulship with Q. Pedius as his colleague through two persons who were themselves irregularly elected to act instead of Consuls (#, Dio 46.45.3) for the purpose (Liv. Per. 119; Res Gest.

     1.12.35; cf. Fer. Cum., ILS 108). The adoption of Octavian as Caesar's son was immediately confirmed by a curiate law (App. BC 3.94; Dio 46.47.5) and the previous declaration of Dolabella (already dead in Syria, see below, Promagistrates) as a public enemy was repealed (App. BC 3.95). At his suggestion his colleague carried a law to set up courts for the trials of Caesar's murderers (see below, on Pedius). He then moved back to Cisalpine Gaul to meet the forces of Antony and Lepidus, and in November came to the agreement with these that established all three as Triumviri rei publicae constituendae (see below; Suet.

Cic. 46.2-4, Ant. 19-20; App. BC 3.96; 4.2-3; Flor. 2.16.6; Dio 46.50, and 5456), and under the terms of the agreement abdicated his consulship by or before November 27 (App. BC 4.2, cf. 6-7; Dio 47.15.2; cf. Fast. Colot., Degrassi 273f., 275).

     These three commanders (see below, Promagistrates, on Antony and Lepidus, and above, Consuls, on Octavian) met in the autumn at the river Lavino near Bononia and determined to seize power, under the title of Triumviri Rei Publicae Constituendae, with consular imperium for five years, to hold powers of appointment of the city magistrates, and to divide the provinces of the West among them, the whole of Gaul except the Narbonese province to Antony, Narbonese Gaul and Nearer Spain to Lepidus, and to Octavian, Sicily, Sardinia, and Africa (Res Gest. D. Aug. 1, and 7; App. BC 4.2-3; Dio 46.54-56; cf, Suet. Aug. 27.1; 96.1; Plut.

They also listed eighteen cities and their lands for division among the soldiers (App. BC 4.3, cf. 86; cf. ILS 886), and initiated an extensive proscription in order to rid themselves of personal enemies and to secure funds for their soldiers (Liv. Per. 120; Vell. 2.66.1; Suet.

Antony claimed to be in communication with him all the while (Phil. 13.43) and upon his retreat from Mutina was received by Lepidus, with whom he united his forces (Cic.

The Senate declared him a public enemy and rescinded his honors, while Marcus Brutus protested this action in an attempt to save his property for his children (Cic.

With Antony he secured the support of Pollio and Plancus, and the death of Decimus Brutus (see below, on these), and returned to Cisalpine Gaul to meet Octavian and establish the Second Triumvirate (see below, on Antony and Octavian; and above, on Triumviri R. P. C.). Lepidus celebrated a triumph ex Hispania on December 31 (Act. Tr., Degrassi 86f., 566; Fast. Barb., ibid. 342f.; Vell. 2.67.4; App. BC 4.31).

Fam. 10.31- 33). Later he marched into Gaul with two legions but there joined Antony and reconciled Plancus with him and Lepidus (App. BC 3.81, and 97; cf. Vell. 2.63.3-4; see above, on Antony and Lepidus).

     Proconsul in Syria (prescripts of Cic. Fam. 12.11, and 12, May 7; Liv. Per. 121; Vell. 2.62.3; App. BC 3.63; Dio 46.40.3-4; 47.28.5, and 29.6). His command was not legitimized until late in April, despite Cicero's proposal early in March that he be given maius imperium and general command against Dolabella (Phil. 11.30-31; 13.30; Fam. 12.7. 1). In fact he had entered the province early in 43 and by March 7 had obtained command of the former forces of Caecilius Bassus, Marcius Crispus, Staius Murcus, and A. Allienus (Cic. Fam. 12.11, and 12; Ad Brut. 2.3.3; Phil. 11.32; Vell. 2.69.2; Joseph. AJ 14.271-272 and 320; BJ 1.219; App. BC 3.78; 4.59; Dio

Per. 121; Strabo 16.2.9; Vell. 2.69.2; App. BC 4.60-62; Dio 47.30.3-6), and punished both Laodiceia and Tarsus for supporting him (Strabo 16.2.9; App. BC 4.62, and 64; 5.7; Dio 47.30.7-31.5; cf.

     He was probably a Proquaestor under Pollio in Farther Spain when in the spring of 43 he embarrassed him by outrages upon citizens of Gades and by absconding with his treasury (Cic. Fam. 10.32, quaestor; cf. Strabo 3.5.3). See 44, Quaestors; PIR² 2.310, no. 1331.

     Proconsul in Syria (see 44, Consuls). Entering Asia late in 44 or early in 43, he rewarded Trebonius for arranging to feed and supply his army by capturing Smyrna by surprise and putting him to death (Cic.

     Proconsul in Macedonia (Cic. Phil. 10.26; see 44, Promagistrates). When C. Antonius attempted to succeed him in Macedonia he rallied to Brutus, and the Senate prolonged his command under the general command of Brutus (Cic. Phil. 10. 11 and 13 and 24 and 26; Plut. Brut. 25.2; Dio 47.21.4; cf. I. de Delos 4.1622–ILS 9460). Late in 43 or early in 42 he executed C. Antonius at Brutus' command (see above, on C. Antonius). According to Grant (From Imperium to Auctoritas 33-35), he was the founder, under Brutus, of a colony at Thessalonica.

     His private command and army were legitimized early in January by a grant with Cicero's sponsorship of imperium pro praetore, while the veterans he had diverted from Antony were to be rewarded at the public cost, and he was permitted to be a candidate for office ten years before the legal date and to possess a consular place (Cic. Phil. 5.45-46 and 53; 13.22; 14.6; Ad Brut. 1.15.7; Res Gest. D. Aug. 1; Liv. Per. 118; Vell. 2.61.3; Suet.

     Aug. 10.3; Plut. Cic. 45.3; Ant. 17.1; App. BC 3.5051, and 64, and 88; Dio 46.29). He assumed the fasces on January 7 at Spoletium (Fer. Cum., ILS 108; 112; Plin. NH 11.190). He co-operated with the Consuls Hirtius and Pansa, shared in the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, and was saluted as Imperator along with them (Cic.

    </ref>
    <ref>
     After the death of the Consuls he refused to co-operate with Decimus Brutus and kept the legions of Hirtius with him, though commanded by the Senate to give them over (Cic. Fam. 10. 24.3; 11. 14.2, and 19. 1, and 20.4; App. BC 3.76, and 97), and was alienated from the Senate when Brutus and Cassius were given great commands (see these), and Decimus Brutus was decreed a triumph, while his ovatio, proposed by Cicero, was refused (Cic. Ad Brut. 1.15.9, and 4.4; Liv. Per. 119; Vell. 2.62.4-5; App. BC 3.74, and 80, and 82, and 89; Dio 46.40.1 and 3). Moreover, his soldiers resented both that he was not appointed to the board to reward them and that a senatorial commission attempted, disregarding him, to deal directly with them (Cic. Fam. 11.20.1-3, and 21.2; Vell. 2.62.5; Plut. Cic. 45; App. BC 3.74, and 86, and 89; Dio 46.40.4-41.4, cf. Liv. Per. 119). For over three months after the relief of Mutina he remained inactive, probably encouraging agitation for his consulship (Cic. Fam. 10.24.4-5; Ad Brut. 1.4A.4, and 10.3; Plut. Cic. 45-46; Comp. Dem. and Cic. 4; App. BC 3.82, and 92; Dio 46.41.5, and 42- 43), and preparing both for a restoration of relations with Antony and Lepidus (App. BC 3.80; Dio 46.41-42, and

     Upon receipt in Rome of news of Brutus' capture of Macedonia and Illyricum and his siege of C. Antonius (see above) his command was legitimized by the Senate as Proconsul in Macedonia, Achaea and Illyricum on Cicero's motion and over the protests of Fufius Calenus (Cic. Phil. 10, passim, esp. 25-26; 13.30; Ad Brut. 2.4.4, and 5.2; App. BC 3.79; 4.58; Dio 46.40.3; 47.22; cf. Cic. Fam. 12.4.2). Later he probably received a maius imperium, extending into Asia too, since he operated there (see below), and Hortensius in Macedonia was subject to his command (Vell. 2.62.2; App. BC 3.63-64; Plut. Brut. 27; see above, on Hortensius, and C. Antonius). He kept C. Antonius for a time in honorable captivity (see above) while protesting violently against honors for Octavian (Cic. Ad Brut. 1.4A.3, and 12, and 15.6-8, and 16, and 17), and after Mutina against the confiscation of Lepidus' property (Cic. Ad Brut. 1.13, and 12, and 15.10-13, and 18.6). In the spring he moved eastward intending to campaign against Dolabella, and disregarded appeals to return to aid the situation in Italy (Cic. Ad Brut. 1.2A.1, and 2.1-2, and 5.1-2, and 6.3; and on the appeals, 1.9.3, and 10.1, and 14.2, and 15.12, and 18). Brutus continued to gather supplies and troops in the East, was saluted as Imperator for victories in Thrace, and at the end of the year moved back to Asia to meet Cassius at Smyrna (Cic. Ad Brut. 1. 15.12, and 18; Liv. Per. 122; Plut. Brut. 28; App. BC 4.75; Dio 47.22-25; and note coins, Grueber, CRRBM 2.471-473, Procos., and 475-477, Imp.).

     Proconsul in Cisalpine Gaul (see 44, Promagistrates; cf. Cic. Fam. 11. 11, and 12, and 13, and 18-19, and 2 1, and 24, all with the prescript Imp. Cos. Desig.; Phil. 5.24 and 35). Antony besieged him in Mutina until he was relieved in April by the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina (see above, Consuls, on Hirtius, and Pansa; Promagistrates, on Octavian, and Antony). He was then honored with the decree of a triumph (Liv. Per. 119; Vell. 2.62.4; Dio 46.40) and a supplicatio of fifty days (Cic. Fam. 11.18.3; App. BC 3.74; Dio 46.39.3). After the death of Hirtius and Pansa he was placed in command of the consular armies, but Hirtius' troops remained with Octavian, who refused to co-operate with him and kept one of Pansa's legions also (Liv. Per. 119-120; App. BC 3.76, and 80, cf. 73, and 74; Dio 46.40, and 50.1; cf. Cic. Fam. 11.10.4, and 13, and 14, and 20.4; see above, on Octavian). Meantime Brutus pursued Antony with what haste he could, but the latter outdistanced him, diverted his forces, and succeeded in uniting with Lepidus (Cic. Fam. 11.11-24, passim, esp. 11.13; see above, on Antony). Brutus could only join Plancus in Gaul, and when the latter went over to Antony and Lepidus he attempted by circling northward to escape to Brutus in Macedonia but was arrested by a Celtic chieftain and killed at Antony's behest (Liv. Per. 119-120; Vell. 2.63-64; 87.2; Plut. Brut. 28.1; App. BC 3.96-4.1; Dio 46.53;

     Proconsul in Transalpine Gaul. (see 44, Promagistrates; Imp. Cos. Desig. in the prescripts to Cic. Fam. 10.8, and 24; cf. Phil. 5.5). In constant communication with Cicero, to whom he made frequent professions of loyalty, though he joined with Lepidus in March in advocating a peaceful settlement of the dispute with Antony (Cic. Fam. 10.6-24, passim, esp. 10.6), he also remained in communication with Antony (Cic. Phil. 13.44, Antony's claim; and cf. for an estimate of him, Fam. 10.3.3, and 11.9.2). He was urged by decree of the Senate to bring aid to Italy, and crossed the Rhone on April 26, and upon hearing of the battles at Mutina remained in touch with Lepidus, at whose invitation he moved southward across the Isara on May 18, but retreated when the latter united his forces with those of Antony (Cic. Fam. 10.9-23, esp. 10.11.2, and 15.18, and 21, and 23). Decimus Brutus joined him on June 7 (see above), but in the course of the summer he was reconciled by Pollio to Antony and Lepidus, surrendered his legions to them and his command to Antony (see Legates, on Varius Cotyla), while Brutus took to flight (Cic.

     46.53.1-2; see above, on D. Brutus and Asinius Pollio). Late in 44 or early in 43 he founded the colonies of Lugdunum and Rauraca (CIL 10.6087-ILS 886; Senec. Apoc. 6; Epp. Mor. 91.14; Suet. Rel., ed. Roth, p. 289 in Jerome, Chr. ad ann. 25, p. 164 Helm; Dio 46.50.4-6). He celebrated a triumph ex Raetis on December 29 (Act. Tr., Degrassi 86f., 567; Fast. Barb., ibid. 342f.; CIL 10.6087-ILS 886; cf. Vell. 2.67.4, ex Gallia). He later rebuilt the temple of Saturn (CIL 6.1316-ILS 41; 10.6087-ILS 886; Suet. Aug. 29.5).

     He proceeded to Massilia with his army and fleet, probably spending much of this inactive year in building and preparation (Cic. Phil. 13.13; App. BC 4.84; Dio 45.10.6; 48.17.1). There a delegation from the Senate came to ask his assistance against Antony at Mutina, while Cicero proposed honors for him and offered to nominate him for his father's place among the Augurs (Cic. Phil. 13.12-13 and 50). By April he had been appointed Praefectus Classis et Orae Maritimae, probably with an imperium pro consule (Vell. 2.73.1-2; App. BC 4.84-85, cf. 3.4; Dio 46.40.3; 47.12.2; 48.17.1; on his title, see also Grueber, CRRBM 2.560f.; see Hadas, Sextus Pompey, 63-67). In August Octavian included him in the condemnation of Caesar's murderers (Dio 46.48.4; 47.12.2; 48.17.2), and at the end of the year he was placed on the list of the proscribed (App. BC 4.96; Dio 47.12.2; 48.17.3; Oros. 6.18.19; Zonar. 10.16), and began his campaign to occupy Sicily (see 42, Promagistrates).

He brought cavalry from Ambracia through Thessaly to join Brutus at Heraclea (Cic. A d Brut. 1. 4a. 4, and 6. 1). He was proscribed at the end of the year (App. BC 4.19-20). See also Cic. Ad Brut. 1.5.

     Leaving Lepidus in charge in Rome, and dividing seven of his ten legions between them (Plut. Ant. 22; App. BC 4.3; Dio 47.20.1), Antony and Octavian, after a diversion against Sextus Pompey, brought their main forces to Macedonia and finally succeeded in crushing the forces of Brutus and Cassius in two battles at Philippi, the first unsuccessful, the second and final one on October 23 (Liv.

After Philippi the Triumviri redivided their armies, and decided to disband and provide settlements for all the soldiers who had completed their term of service. They also redivided their provinces. Antony kept Transalpine Gaul, to which he added the Narbonese province while attaching the Cisalpine one to Italy, and went on to recapture the East. Octavian retained both Africas, Sardinia and Sicily. Lepidus was to give up Spain, probably to Octavian, and to receive some compensation (it was eventually Africa) if suspicious reports regarding his loyalty should prove unfounded (see 41, Triumviri R. P. C.). Antony was to collect funds in the East while Octavian proceeded with the distribution of land and the settlement of veteran colonies in Italy. (Vell. 2.74.1; Joseph.

  <footnote class="ref" ref="_bookmark345">
   1 The use of the terms Legate and Proconsul under the Second Triumvirate is of necessity attended by uncertainty and confusion. Commanders, like Ventidius Bassus, who were for the most part ex-Consuls, held command over large and important areas and armies, and apparently acted with considerable initiative, are termed Legati in Latin sources such as the Periochae of Livy and Florus and # in Dio (Liv. Per. 127, 128; Flor. 2.19; Dio 48.41.5; cf. 49.21, and Act. Tr. for 38, on the title and triumph of Ventidius), and yet many of them appear in the lists of triumphs as Proconsuls. In mentioning the triumph of Domitius Calvinus, Dio (48.42.3-4) remarks that those in power granted honors at will # (see also 49.42.3; 54.12.1-2). Mommsen finds the beginning of this contradiction in Caesar's grant of triumphs at the end of 45 to his Legates Fabius Maximus and Q. Pedius (see 45, Promagistrates). Like these, the later commanders were Legates also under the superior imperium of the Triumviri, and their appearance as Proconsuls depended upon a fictive grant of imperium for the day of their triumph (Str. 1.125, 130f.; 2.245, note 1). The term Proconsul cannot refer to their status in command since a Legate never had more than an imperium pro praetore. The term Legatus pro consule does not occur, and indeed cannot occur because it is intrinsically self-contradictory (ibid. 1.130f.). Moreover it was simply this permission to triumph that made it logically possible for some of these Legates to accept acclamation as Imperator (see, on Sosius, Mommsen Str. 1.125). Mommsen's doctrine is difficult to test because in nearly all cases no official inscriptions remain from the period of command, and several of the commands are known only from the record of the triumph (see 34-32, Promagistrates, on Norbanus Flaccus, Statilius Taurus, Marcius Philippus, Olaudius Pulcher, and L. Cornificius). The term Legatus in Livy and Florus is strongly in his favor, since Die might have been affected by the regular system of Legati pro praetore in the Empire. However, as Canter saw (46-55), the situation was more complicated. The illogicality of a subordinate with an imperium pro consule occurs under Antony on the official coinage in Greece of M. lunius Silanus, who terms himself Quaestor pro consule (see 34, Promagistrates; note that in the Empire Pliny could be given the exceptional position of Legatus pro praetore consulari potestate), and raises the question how many commanders senior to Silanus may not also have held an imperium pro consule under the superior imperium of the Triumviri. Moreover, Sosius (Cos. 32) apparently termed himself Imperator on his coinage from 37 B. C. (see 37, Promagistrates), on a rather distant anticipation of the moment of a fictive grant of imperium pro consule for a day in 34; and there were others, like Laronius (see 33, Consules Suffecti), who took the title Imperator and did not triumph at all. The period of the Second Triumvirate was a period of transition in which irregularities and illogicalities could frequently occur in the government of the Roman Empire, before the Augustan regime rebuilt the pattern anew. I have therefore been inclined to keep the question open; and to list among the Promagistrates the holders of important commands under Octavian and Antony who received acclamation as Imperatores or celebrated triumphs. It must be granted that the superior position of the Triumvirs in this period made the difference between the functions of a Promagistrate and of a Legate much less than it had been before. See Ganter 46-55.

Incited by Antony's wife Fulvia, he soon clashed with Octavian regarding the confiscation of lands in cities of Italy and their distribution among veterans. After first attempting to maintain the interest of his brother in the settlement of veterans he later claimed to be a protector of the towns, and a champion of the rights of the Consuls against the Triumvir Octavian. Several attempts at agreement with Octavian, mainly caused by pressure from the soldiers, proved ineffectual, and war broke out, with L. Antonius by the end of the year tightly besieged in Perusia awaiting the hesitant help of the forces under the various Antonian commanders in Italy (App. BC 4.12-34; Dio 48.5-14; cf. Liv. Per. 125-126; Vell. 2.74.2-3; Suet. Aug. 13-14; Plut. Ant. 30.1; Flor. 2.16; Eutrop. 7.3.4; Oros. 6.18.17-18; see below, Promagistrates, on Asinius Pollio, Munatius Plancus, and Ventidius Bassus). Meantime Servilius remained quietly in the background (Dio 48.13.4).

     In accordance with his agreement with Octavian (see 42, Triumviri R. P. C.), Antony proceeded with his task of raising money and supplies, and of reorganizing the East. He went first to Bithynia and then to Asia, summoned Cleopatra from Egypt to meet him in Cilicia, and went on to Syria, and spent the winter of 41-40 in Egypt (Plut. Ant. 23-30; App. BC 5.4-11; Dio 48.24-25; cf. on Tarsus, Strabo 14.5.14; on his fleet, Plut. Ant. 30; App. BC 5.55; on his exactions in Asia, App. BC 5.5-7; Plut. Ant. 24.5-6; Dio 42.24; and Joseph.

     Finding Lepidus innocent of suspicion of disloyalty, Octavian transferred to him command of the province of Africa, a command which he did not exercise until the summer of 40 (App. BC 5. 12; Dio 48.5. 1; see 42, and 40, Triumviri R. P. C.). He was still in Rome when the Perusine war began, and fled the city at the approach of Lucius Antonius (Liv. Per. 125; App. BC 5.30; Dio 48.13.3-4).

Either bringing an army, or more probably recalling soldiers into service, he advanced toward Perusia, but being uncertain of Mark Antony's wishes did not press the effort to relieve Lucius Antonius (App. BC 5.20, and 31, he impeded the advance toward Spain and return of Octavian's Lieutenant Salvidienus; 5.32, his advance toward Perusia; cf.

     In Donatus, Vit. Verg. (ed. Brummer, p. 16) these three men receive the traditional title Triumviri agris dividendis (see also Schol. Bern., Jahrb. f. Philol., Supb. 9 [1867], p. 743; Iun. Philargyr. II, on Eclogue I, Proem.). Our sources also describe their position as follows: Pollio agris praeerat dividundis (Serv. on Eel. 2.1); qui praeesset Transpadanae regioni (Iun. Philargyr. II on Eel. 6.7; cf. Iun. Philargyr. I and II on Eel. 4.3); Alfenus qui agros divisit (Serv. Dan. on Eel. 9.10); victo enim Antonio Caesar Alphenum, Varum in locum Pollionis constituit (Iun. Philargyr. II on Ecl. 6.7); Gallus a Triumviris praeposilus fuit ad exigendas pecunias ab his municipiis, quorum agri in Transpadana regione non dividebantur (Serv. Dan. on Eel. 6.64). Polio and Alfenus Varus are named also in the following passage: ... fugatoque Asinio Pollione, ab Augusto Alfenum, Varum legatum, substitutum, qui Transpadanae provinciae et agris dividendis praeessel (Sery. Dan. on Eel. 6.6). The activities of these men in the confiscation of land and the settlement of veterans in the Transpadane region brought them into contact with Vergil, whose land in the territory of Mantua was supposedly either confiscated, and later returned to him, or, according the Donatus life of Vergil (ed. Brummer, p. 5), he received an indemnity. The references to their activities deal exclusively with Vergil's land.

    <ref>
     Bayet (REL 6 [1928] 271-299) interprets these notices to mean that these men formed a board of three like the senatorial land cominissions of Gracchan and earlier times (see p. 276). But Gallus, being a knight, not a senator, was technically ineligible for such an appointment. Moreover, the passage of Serv. Dan. on Ecl. 6.64 indicates
    </ref>
    <ref>
     that his task was not to divide land but to exact money from towns whose land was not divided, a task more
    </ref>
    <ref>
     suitable for an equestrian Prefect (cf. on 9.10 for a fragment of his speech of protest to Alfenus Varus for taking too much land from Montua). The system used by Antony and Octavian in dividing the land among their soldiers probably followed closely the system of Prefects and other officers, including Promagistrates, who received grants of imperium for the purpose, which Caesar used for the settlement of his veterans (see 45, Prefects, on C. Clovius; 44, Prefects, on Plotius Plancus; and note also App. BC 2.120, regard- ing the multitude of soldiers in Rome in March, 44, #). Q. Valerius Orca performed this function under Caesar as Legatus pro praetore (see 45, Legates). Munatius Plancus was probably a Proconsul when he distributed lands at Beneventum in this year (ILS 886); and in this period L. Memmius distributed lands at Luca to the sixth and the twenty-sixth legions as Prefect for the purpose (ILS 887). The members therefore of this so-called commission were probably individual appointees, with or without imperium, Pollio probably a Proconsul until he assumed the consulship in 40, Alfenus Varus probably a Legate or a Prefect but possibly also a Promagistrate, and Gallus almost certainly an equestrian Prefect. The old senatorial commissions were practically obsolete (see Grant, From Imperium to Auctoritas 9-11).

     Roused from his winter in Egypt by news of the Parthian invasion of Syria under Labienus, Antony proceeded to Phoenicia, where full details reached him of the course and outcome of the Perusine war, probably followed soon after by news of Octavian's seizure of Transalpine Gaul. Gathering his forces he went to Greece and after secret negotiations with Sextus Pompey began an invasion of Italy, but friends (and soldiers) of both leaders intervened and negotiated the Pact of Brundisium (Vell. 2.76; Plut. Ant. 30; App. BC 5.52-64; Dio 48.15, and 24, and 27- 28; cf. Scholia on Hor. Sat. 1.5.29-Livy, fr. 51-53 W, referring to 37). A new distribution of provinces placed the western provinces under the control of Octavian, while Antony kept command of all provinces east of Scodra on the Adriatic, and Lepidus continued in Africa. Both were to have access to Italy and to have the right to levy recruits there, and Antony, since Fulvia had died, agreed to marry Octavian's sister Octavia and to aid in the struggle with Sextus Pompey (Plut. Ant. 30; Suet. Nero 3.2; Tac. Ann. 1.10; App. BC 5.65 and 93; Dio 48.28-30; 50.1.3, and 26.1; Zonar. 10.22). Both, acclaimed Imperatores, went to Rome to celebrate the wedding and games for the peace, but famine and riots due to the operations of Sextus Pompey compelled them to seek negotiations with him (App. BC 5.65-69; Dio 48.30-33; Liv. Per. 127; cf. Vell. 2.76.4-77.1; Plut. Ant. 31.2-32.1; Suet. Aug. 16.1; Oros. 6.18.19-20; Zonar. 10.22).

     He brought the Perusine war to a conclusion with the surrender of Lucius Antonius, whom he spared although he put to death many knights, senators and Perusines among his following (App. BC 5.34-49, and 61.

Schol. on Lucan 1.41, p. 14 U), while many Antonians, including his wife Fulvia, his mother Iulia, and a number of Antonian commanders, left Italy. Octavian's opportunity came when the death of Fufius Calenus in Gaul enabled him to seize command of eleven legions there (App. BC 5.50-51, cf. 54, and 59, and 60, and 61; Dio 48.20.3-4; cl.

     The Triumvirs secured ratification from the Senate of their acts to date, levied new taxes, appointed new senators, and named magistrates for several years in advance (Dio 48.34-35). Famine in the city and disorders compelled Antony and Octavian to make overtures to Sextus Pompey which after some hesitation he accepted, and an agreement for peace was arranged and celebrated at Puteoli (Plut. Ant. 32; App. BC 67-74; Dio 48.36-38; cf. Vell. 2.77; Flor. 2.18.4; Oros. 6.18.20).

     The terms were as follows: commerce should be open; Pompey should remove his garrisons from Italy, keep Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily, and receive the Peloponnese; he undertook not to harbour runaway slaves; exiles were permitted to return, except those implicated in the murder of Caesar, and should receive their property again, except that the proscribed should get one-fourth; some were to receive tribuneships, praetorships, and priesthoods at once; the slaves in Pompey's forces should remain free, and the freemen should receive the same rewards as the soldiers of Antony and Octavian; Pompey himself was designated Consul for 33, and was to be raised to his father's priesthood, the augurate, and receive 70 million HS from his father's estate (Plut., App., Dio, as above; ILS 8891; cf. Liv. Per. 127; Vell. 2.77; Tac. Ann. 5.1; Dio 48.15.1-2, and 36.1 and 3-6, and 37.1; Auct.

     Antony then departed to Greece with Octavia to make preparation for the Parthian war and appointments of sub- commanders and kings, and wintered at Athens, meantime collecting the tribute from the Peloponnese before giving it to Sextus Pompey (Plut. Ant. 33; App. BC 5.75-76; Dio 48.35.1, and 39.2; cf. Grueber CRRBM 2.502- 505; IG 2.482, line 23; Senec. Suas. 1.6; Socrat. Rhod., in FGrH 2B.927f.). He accepted a salutation as Imperator for the victories of Pollio and Ventidius (see Promagistrates; Grueber, CRRBM 2.505f.; see CAH 10.50, note 1). Octavian meanwhile departed to Gaul (App. BC 75) but returned soon to face, as he claimed, a resumption of piratical activity on the part of Sextus Pompey (App. BC 5.77; Flor. 2.18.5; cf. Dio 48.45.4-9, under 38). Lepidus remained inconspicuously governor of Africa, retaining the Antonian legions formerly commanded by Sextius (App. BC 5.71, and 75).

     The outbreak of fresh hostilities between Octavian and Sextus Pompey brought Antony hastily back to Italy for a meeting with Octavian at which the latter failed to appear (App. BC 5.78-79; Dio 48.46). Antony then proceeded to Syria where he superseded the victorious Ventidius Bassus (see below), and went on with the siege of Antiochus of Commagene at Samosata, but ended by negotiating a settlement (Plut.

     Antony placed him in command of Syria and Cilicia (Joseph. AJ 14.447; BJ 1.327; Dio 49.22.3; Oros. 6.18.24), probably with the proconsular imperium since he later (see 34, Promagistrates) received the title Imperator and celebrated a triumph. He subdued the Aradians (Dio 49.22.3; cf. Plut. Ant. 34.6), and received the commission to restore Herod to his kingdom of Judaea (Liv. Per. 128; Joseph. AJ 14.447; BJ 1.327; Dio 49.22.3-6; Oros. 6.18.24, with the name Ventidius).

Agrippa had probably been placed in charge in 38 of the preparation and training of a new fleet against Sextus Pompey (see 38, Triumviri B. P. C., on Octavian, and Promagistrates, on Agrippa). He spent much of the year building the protected Lucrine harbour, equipping the vessels and training the crews (Dio 48.49-51; cf. Verg. Georg. 2.161-164, and Serv. ad loc.; Liv. Per. 128; Strabo 5.4.6; Vell. 2.79.2- 3; Senec. Benef. 6.32.3; Plin. NH 36.125; Suet. Aug. 16.1; Flor. 2.18.6; Serv. Dan. on Verg. Aen. 8.682, and Serv. on 693; Cassiod. Chr. ad ann.; and on the ships and weapons, App. BC 5.106 and 118). Precisely when Agrippa also became admiral in succession to Calvisius (see Promagistrates, on Calvisius), is not certain, but it was probably early in the year.

     At a meeting at Tarentum in the spring of this year Antony and Octavian agreed to extend the Triumvirate for a second term of five years, counting retroactively from the end of the first on December 31, 38, and to maintain the same division of provinces as at the Pact of Brundisium in 40 (Fast. Cap., Degrassi 58f., 135, 506f.; App. BC 5.95; Dio 48.54.6; cf. on Octavian's title, Act.

     Antony had also returned to bring aid at Octavian's request (see 38, Legates, on Maecenas), but the latter was unwilling to accept it. Octavia's mediation led to the meeting at Tarentum (see above), where Antony also agreed to loan Octavian 120 ships, to which Octavia secured the addition of 20 more, while Octavian in return was to give Antony 20,000 Italian legionaries (and actually did add a guard of 1000 for Octavia herself), and Sextus Pompey was to be debarred from his promised consulate and augurate (App. BC 5.94-95; Dio 48.54; cf. Plut. Ant. 35; and Hor. Sat. 1.5, and Scholiasts). Antony then returned to the East, sending Octavia back from Corcyra (cf. Dio 48.54.5) and leaving his children in Italy, but his return to Italy had cost him the opportunity presented by a year of dynastic crisis in Parthia (Plut. Ant. 35-37; App. BC 5.95; Dio 48.54.5-6; 49.23; cf. Iustin. 42.4.15-5

     Octavian's great task, in which Lepidus was to share, was the defeat of Sextus Pompey and the winning of Sicfiy. With Antony's ships on the one hand and Agrippa's new fleet on the other, and a considerable army poised for the crossing of the Sicilian strait, he began serious operations about the first of July. Agrippa was victorious in the naval battle at Mylae and began to reduce the ports on the northern coast of Sicily, but the forces that crossed in the meantime with Octavian to Tauromenium were cut off by Pompey's navy and placed in a precarious situation until they fought their way under Cornificius toward Agrippa at Mylae. Octavian meantime with the eastern navy and the forces in Italy was isolated and placed in jeopardy on the Italian side of the straits. After the relief of the forces already in Sicily Octavian managed to ferry the rest of his army to Sicily, and uniting with Lepidus (see below) stood ready to attack Messana. At this point Sextus Pompey decided to stake all upon a naval battle at Naulochus on September 3, and when defeated fled to the East with a few followers, while his Lieutenants, his army, and the remnants of his fleet surrendered (App. BC 5.96-122; Dio 49.1-10; cf. ILS 8893; Liv. Per. 129; Vell. 2.79; Plin. NH 7.178; Suet. Aug. 16; Flor. 2.18.7-9; Eutrop. 7.6; Oros. 6.18.25-30; Zonar. 10.25; and on the date of Naulochus, Fast.

     Meantime Lepidus, who came from Africa in fulfillment of his part of the plan of attack (App. BC 5.97-98; Dio 49.1.1), captured the southern and western parts of the island, and at Messana accepted the surrender of the town over Agrippa's objections in Octavian's absence, and added Pompey's forces to his own. Octavian won his army from him, expelled him from membership in the Triumvirate (without waiting to consult Antony), and from his provincial command, but left him his life and his priesthood (App. BC 5.117, and 122-126, and 134; Dio 49.8, and 11-12; 50.1.3, and 20.3; cf.

     Octavian had then to calm a mutiny among the veterans with distributions of rewards and with promises (Vell. 2.81; App. BC 5.127-129; Dio 49.13-15; Oros. 6.18.33; on the settlement at Capua, see CIL 10.3938-ILS 6317; Strabo 10.4.9; Vell. 2.81.2; Dio 49.14.5). He received high honors upon his return to Rome, including an ovatio and the personal sacrosanctity of a Tribune of the Plebs (App. BC 5.130-132; Dio 49.15; cf. on the ovatio, Act. Tr., Degrassi 86f., 569; Fast. Barb., ibid. 342f.; Res Gest. D. Aug. 4; Suet. Aug. 22; Oros. 6.18.34; Jerome Chr. ad ann. 33, p. 162 Helm). He now gave attention to the problem of restoring order in Italy (App. BC 5.132; cf. CIL 12.2.1860-ILS 2488; Suet. Aug. 32. 1; see Promagistrates, on Calvisius).

In the later stages of the campaign he was sent to capture Pompey's supply bases on the island (App. BC 5.118), and after the demotion of Lepidus completed the subjugation of the island (Oros. 6.18.32, Caesaris praefectus), and was then appointed Proconsul of the two African provinces (App. BC 5.129; Dio 49.14.6; cf.

     Antony's commanders in Asia Minor captured Sextus Pompey and put him to death perhaps, though not certainly, at Antony's command (see below). He accepted a small body of reinforcements brought him by Octavia but sent her back from Athens to Rome (Plut. Ant. 53-54; Dio 49.33.3-4; Zonar. 10.26; cf. App. BC 5.138), while he went on with preparations for another invasion of Armenia and Parthia, this time aided by the desertion of Artavasdes of Media to his side (Liv. Per. 13 1; Plut. Ant. 52; App. BC 5.145; Dio 49.33, and 44; cf. Oros. 6.19.3). Meantime his supposed victories of the previous year had received formal honors in Rome (Dio 49.18.6-7, and 32.1-2).

     Octavian first returned to Sicily with the apparent intention of going to Africa (Dio 49.34. 1), then returned to the north, appointed Antistius to a Gallic command against the Salassi (see below, Promagistrates), and began his first Illyrian expedition. He was successful in clearing the upper Adriatic by sea and subdued the Iapudes and other tribes, capturing the towns of Metulum and Siscia, where he left a garrison of two legions for the winter (App. Illyr. 12-24; Dio 49.34-38; cf.

     In a third expedition into Armenia Antony penetrated to the Araxes. He gave the Median king a portion of Armenia and betrothed his son Alexander to the daughter of the Mede, and received the standards which had been captured in 36 from Oppius Statianus (Dio 49.44.2-3; cf. Plut. Ant. 56.1). Relations with Octavian steadily deteriorated as envoys went back and forth with charge and counter-charge (Dio 50.1.1-2.2; cf. Suet. Aug. 63.2, and 69-70; Plut. Ant. 55).

     Antony, and promised to prove his charges against Antony when the Senate reconvened. Before then the Consuls and 300 senators left Rome to join Antony in Ephesus (Dio 50.2-7; cf. 49.41.4). In the East with Antony, Domitius urged him to send Cleopatra away to Egypt (Plut. Ant. 56.2; cf. Yell. 2.84:.2). He probably became a commander in Antony's fleet (Strabo 1 ~t. 1. 4:2).

Octavian's use of titles is uncertain (cf. the vague terms of Res Gest. D. Aug. 34), but in his opposition to the Consuls, his seizure of Antony's will from the house of the Vestals, his declaration of war against Cleopatra, his exaction of a personal oath of allegiance from almost all the communities of the West, his exactions of taxes and mobilization of forces, he assumed full powers over those of Consuls or Proconsuls as a leader for war (Res Gest.

Degrassi (570), perhaps rightly, dates the triumphs of Claudius and Cornificius in 33, in spite of the very short interval after that of Marcius Philippus, since otherwise Cornificius would have celebrated his during the war with Antony.

     Agrippa was Octavian's admiral in chief throughout the Actium campaign. In the spring he crossed to Greece, intercepted Antony's supplies, and captured a number of strategic points, such as Methone, Corcyra, which became Octavian's base, Leucas and Patrae. His victory on September 2 at Actium was decisive, and was followed by the destruction of Antony's fleet and the surrender of his army. After the victory Agrippa proceeded as far as the capture of Corinth, and was then sent back to Italy with the main body of veterans, and there shared jointly with Maecenas full power as Octavian's representative while he was absent in the East.

     CIL 9.262 terms him Quindecimvir and Imperator, and should probably be dated early in his career since there is no mention of his consulate; cf. Vell. 2.127.1. A patrician after 29. See PIR 3.439, no. 457; De Laet no. 420; Reinhold, Marcus Agrippa 62, 104.

   <office-note name="The following list represents the probable membership of this college of priests about 31 B. C. In a number of instances the exact date when a priest became a member of his college is not known, and the conjecture is based on evidence of seniority such as the date of the consulship or some other office. The list of the Quindecimviri is based on Miss Hoffman's observation that the names listed in connection with the Saecular Games in 17 B. C. are arranged in the order of entrance into the college (see AJPh 73 [19521289-294). The names given below are drawn from Miss Hoffman's dissertation, The Membership of the Four Major Colleges of Priests from 44 B. C. to 37 A. D. (Bryn Mawr, 1951, available in microfilm)."/>
