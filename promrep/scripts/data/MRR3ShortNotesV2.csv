Curator denariorum landorum? In MRR 2.432, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.298f., no. 282, 118 B.C. He was a junior associate of the IIviri coloniae deducendae for Narbo, L. Licinius Crassus (55) and Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (21), and has his name, along with those of L. Cosconius, C. Malleolus, L. Pomponius, and L. Porcius Licinus, on the coinage. He can hardly be identified with M. Aurelius Scaurus (215) who became Cos. suff. in 108, but he was perhaps the quaestor in the late- second century who wished to prosecute his proconsular commander, L. Flaccus (Cic. Div. in Caec. 63** cf. Badian, Studies 101, note 98** Gnomon 33, 1961, 498). Perhaps father of M. Aurelius M. f. Vol. (a Scaurus? or a Cotta?) in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo at Asculum (see Criniti, L'Epigrafe di Asculum 18, 111-112). See below on no. 216. See Sumner, Orators 79-82, on the generations of Aurelii Scauri** and Badian, Klio 66, 1984, 298-301, who now, in view of Crawford's dating of the moneyer to 118, and Sumner's discussion, would accept the identification of the moneyer with the consul of 108. If so, his son was probably the M. Aurelius Scaurus who was quaestor in Asia of uncertain date (I. de Delos 1858 bis-ILLRP 373** Cic. Verr. 2.1.85, nuper) and may be identified with the M. Aurelius Scaurus who was debarred from prosecuting his proconsul L. Flaccus (Cic. Div. in Caec. 63). Flaccus would be L. Valerius Flaccus (178), proconsul of Asia in the 90s. See below, on Valerius (176, 177, 178). The identity of M. Aurelius M. f. Vol. (see the next entry) remains obscure.
Cos. 50. Monetalis 62. Crawford (RRC 1.441-442, nos. 415- 417, 62 B.C.) identifies the consul of 50, not his son (82), suffect consul in 34, as the monetalis of 62 who issued coins with L. Scribonius Libo in that year. The Libo who was consul in 34 (20) may be either the monetalis of 62 or his son. See also MRR 2.431, 451. Quaestor 60 or 59. Though listed as quaestor in 59 (MRR 2.190), he may possibly have gone to Macedonia with C. Octavius in 60 and continued as proquaestor there. Curule Aedile 55 or 56? His aedileship is not mentioned but it would have been strange to omit it from his cursus. Moreover, since aediles regularly undertook the restoration or maintenance of public buildings, he probably assumed as aedile the task of restoring his ancestral monument, the Basilica Aemilia (Cic. Att. 4.16.8** M?nzer, Hermes 40, 1905, 97f.). The dating of Plancius and Plotius as curule aediles to 55 excludes Paullus from this year: see MRR 2.216, 223** and, below, on Cn. Plancius (4), and A. Plautius (Plotius) (8). In fact, a date in 56, as suggested by M. I. Henderson (JRS 49, 1959, 167), would fit well with his praetorship in 53. The one surely attested curule aedile of 56 is P. Clodius Pulcher (MRR 2.208). A certain Marcellus, probably the future consul of 50 (Shackleton Bailey, CLA 2.178), was a candidate for an aedileship (Cic. Att. 4.3.5), with what success remains unknown. On his name, see Sumner, Orators 65, and Shackleton Bailey, Onom. Lepidus before Paullus is unattested.
Cos. 233, 228, 215, 214, 209. Citing the long periods during which Fabius Ambustus (44) (39 years) and Fabius Rullianus (114) (41 years) held office, Sumner returns to M?nzer, against MRR 1.220, note 1, and attributes to Fabius Gurges the consulship of 265, and thus a similar span for his years of office (28 years). If Fabius Verrucosus, the Cunetator, was an augur for 62 or 63 years (see MRR 2.202, 314, 315, note 10) from 266-265 to his death in 203, he must have been born at least by 280 and probably earlier. Livy however cites only quidam auctores for this (30.27.7). This date would bring him his first consulship at the age of 46 or 47, which is surprisingly late. The term of 62 or 63 years may be the sum of the terms of two Fabii, but evidence is lacking. Moreover, Pliny identifies Ambustus, Rullianus, and Gurges as members of three generations of Fabii who in succession became Principes Senatus, by implication omitting Verrucosus as a member of a fourth, while, as against Livy (30.26.8), who describes Verrucosus as a grandson of Rullianus, Plutarch (Fab. 1.3** 24.5) terms him a great-grandson. Sumner is justified in bringing into the stemma another Q. Fabius Maximus, unknown unless he was the Q. Fabius (30) who was aedile in or by 267 (MRR 1.200-201). See Sumner, Orators 30-32, with stemma. On both the censorship of Fabius Maximus Verrucosus in 230 and his consulship in 209, see above, on M. Aemilius Barbula (33), cos. 230, the remarks on the elogium found at Brindisi.
Cos. 46, 42. Monetalis. See MRR 2.431** Sydenham's date, 66 B.C. (cf. Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 265** C. D. Hamilton, TAPhA 100, 1969, 198), has been revised by Crawford, RRC 1.443, no. 419, to 61 B.C. Curule Aedile 53? See MRR 2.228, and note also Asconius' comment when he was interrex in 52: is enim magistratus curulis erat creatus, where the implication seems to be that he had only recently attained that rank. See E. S. Staveley, Historia 3, 1954, 196-197. Interrex 52. See MRR 2.236. A difficulty is raised in that Asconius (430 names his wife Cornelia, while the wife named by whom he had children was Iunia, daughter of Servilia and D. Iunius Silanus (163). Cos. 62. J. C. Ruebel would emend his praenomen M. to M'., and identify the interrex as M'. Aemilius Lepidus (62). Cos. 66 (TAPhA 109, 1979, 231- 249). But this involves three changes in the text of Asconius, and one in Cic. Mil. 13. The senior consular, if still alive, might well have been the more suitable choice, but on our evidence it seems better to accept M. Lepidus, and suppose his remarriage to Iunia after divorce from Cornelia or her death. Triumvir R. P. C. 11, 37-36, and governor of Africa. See MRR 2.396. In an inscription found at Thabraca in Africa, he has the following titles: imp. tert, pont. max., III vir r. p. c. bis, cos. Iter. It may be dated between spring 37 and his removal from office in September 36. (J. Guey and A. Pernette, Karthago 9, 1958, 79-87** AEpig. 1959, no. 57** ILLRP 1276).
Cos. 156. Procos.? He very probably governed a province after his consulship, for he was convicted of res repetundae (Val. Max 6.9.10 refers wrongly to a Lex Caecilia A39repetundarum, which is usually taken as a mistake for the Lex Calpurnia** see Mommsen, GS 1.16-17** Strafrecht 708, note 3, 729, note 1** and cf. Cic. Brut. 106** Off. 2.75** Festus 360L-285M** Lucilius, 20.607-608, in LCL). But see C. Busacca, Iura 19, 1968, 83-93, who holds that the Lex Caecilia set up a quaestio extraordinaria, through which Lentulus was convicted of res repetundae ca. 154, but which did not involve, like the Lex Calpurnia, the creation of a quaestio perpetua. M. G. Morgan holds, against Zippel and De Sanctis, that Lupus was not the Cornelius mentioned by Polybius (frag. 64 B-W** see Walbank, Comm. Polybius III, p. 748, ad loc.** App. Illyr. 14) who was defeated by the Pannonians, nor the commander who suffered a disaster at the hands of the Scordisci (Historia 23, 1974, 183-216). Xvir s. j. The L. Cornelius Lentulus who in 140 raised the question of bringing an aqueduct to the Capitolium, though termed a praetor in RE nos. 190192, was one of the Xviri s. f. and was acting for the college (Frontin. Aq. 1.7, accepting Schone's emendation pro collegio** cf. Liv. OXy. Per. 54), and may best be identified with the consul of 156 (Sumner, Orators 48). The notices on L. Cornelius Lentulus, Pr. 140, in MRR 1.479, and of any connection with the consul of 130 should be deleted.[67x]
Tr. pl. 91. The evidence for details of his career consists of two not wholly reliable sources: the statements in the brief life, Auct. Vir. Ill. 66, which include the title quaestor in Asia and the phrase aedilis munus magnificentissimum dedit, along with examples of his pride or violence and details about his decline in popularity and death, are part of a late compilation** and the text of an Elogium (ILS 49-Inscr. Ital. 13.3, no. 74), which mentions neither the quaestorship nor the aedileship, depends on copies of along-lost inscription, probably going back to Cyriacus of Ancona, and may be neither complete nor in consecutive order. It is difficult to agree with Sumner (Orators 110-111) that it details all his offices. It is, however, true that in MRR 1.570, note 4, Cicero (Rab. Perd. 21) is incorrectly cited to show that Livius was then a senator and therefore had been a quaestor by or before the censorship of 102-101: he may have been merely one of the iuventus who rallied against Saturninus in 100. For a quaestorship in the East there is at least subsidiary evidence in mention in Pliny of a visit and medication at Anticyra (NH 25.52). For the aedileship which, if true, must come after the quaestorship, there is notice and name of a possible colleague (MRR 2.12, 14, note 1, cf. 473), but Livius still, as Sumner points out, appears to be too young, unless perhaps before Sulla the rules governing the plebeian aedileship were still flexible like those for the tribunate.
Cos. suff. 162. Leg., Amb. 156. On the succession of embassies from 156 to 154 caused by the hostilities between Prusias II of Bithynia and Attalus lI of Pergamum, see Chr. Habicht (Hermes 84, 1956, 90-116, and RE s. v. Prusias II), whose reordering of the relevant fragments of Polybius has been accepted by Walbank (Comm. Polyb. III, on 32.16.1** 33.1** 32.15.1-4** 33.7, 12.1-13.10, with references to earlier discussions on p. 540). See MRR 1.448-451. The attack on Attalus in 156 caused Lentulus to return to Rome with the Attalid prince Athenaeus, but before their arrival a doubting Senate had sent L. Appuleius and C. Petronius. The report of Lentulus and Athenaeus led to the immediate appointment, probably late in 156, of a new embassy, C. Claudius Centho, L. Hortensius and C. Aurunculeius, who reached Pergamum in the spring of 155 in time to arrange a conference which was ruined by Pharnaces' treachery, to be immured in Pergamum and to see the havoc Pharnaces caused. By autumn they had returned to Rome, and a commission of ten was sent, led by L. Anicius Gallus, C. Fannius Strabo, and Q. Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, late in 155 or early in 154, who observed Attalus' victorious counterattack and returned. Finally, in summer 154, a new embassy, Ap. Claudius Centho, L. Oppius, and A. Postumius Albinus, secured peace between the two kings, and the payment of indemnities by Prusias to Attalus and the Greek cities. See also L. Robert, Et. Anat. 110-115.[66x]
Cos. 61. On the forms of his name, see Shackleton Bailey, Studies 126-127. Praetor in 72 (or 71), Procos. in Spain, 71-69? See MRR 2.117, 124, 129, 133. As there is  clear evidence that L. Afranius (6) was active at Termantia and Calagurris (Oros. 5.23.14) and was honored by Valentia, cities in Hisp. Cit. (see above, on Afranius no. 6), it is reasonable to suppose that Piso succeeded Metellus in Hisp. Ult. (MRR 2.123), and continued as proconsul until he returned to celebrate his triumph, still probably in 69 (Cic. Pis. 62** Ascon. 15C), and was thereafter free to become a legatus pro praetore under Pompey in 67 (MRR 2.149). See Ch. F. Konrad, Hispania Antiqua 8, 1978, 67-76. Leg., lieut. 67-62. He was honored as a legatus at Samos (IGRP 4.1709** cf. Mènzer, APF 334, no. 1) and at Miletus (Wiegand, Milet. 3.393, no. 173-AEpig. 1914, no. 211). Wiegand would date the Miletus inscription to the latter part of the period when Pompey was organizing the results of his victories. He is not mentioned after his consulship in 61, so the legatus at Delos under Pompey in 49 (Joseph. AJ 14.231** wrongly attributed in MRR 2.269) should be identified with his son, M. (Pupius) Piso (12), praetor in 44. See ILLRP 377, attributed to the father by Degrassi, but to the son by Syme (JRS 50, 1960, 15-16-RP 2.639), and again to the father by Badian (Acta of the 5th Internat. Congress Gr. & Lat. Epig. 209-214** cf. Shackleton Bailey, Studies 126-127).
Cos. 70, 55. In the Index (MRR 2.580) and the other references to the[119] career of RE no. 68, delete the cognomen Dives. It does not appear in any official lists that have been preserved (see Mènzer RE 13.1.245, against Gelzer on no. 68). It properly belonged to P. Licinius Crassus Dives (69). Cos. 205, and became hereditary in the older branch of the family. Cicero's use of it as comparable to Pompey's Magnus in Att. 2.13.2 distinguishes the praetor of 57, P. Licinius Crassus Dives (71) from his contemporary the Triumvir. See Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.379, and Studies 46** B. A. Marshall, Historia 22, 1973, 459-467, with a stemma of the Licinii Crassi. Aedile? 76. Remarks by Sicinius (9), Tr. pl. 76, may imply that Crassus was in office then (Plut. Crass. 7.9** see T. J. Cadoux, G&R 3, 1956, 154, note 5). If he was aedile, 73 becomes still more probable for his praetorship. Procos. 72. Shatzman (Athenaeum 46, 1968, 345-354) and Badian (ibid. 48, 1970, 6-8) both interpret Appian (BC 1.118) to mean that Crassus was praetor in 73, consistent with the Leges Annales, and, after the defeat of the consul of 72 in the war with Spartacus, was invested with command in 72- 71 as a privatus cum imperio. Cf. MRR 2.118, 121, note 2, and 123. Note also that Plutarch (Crass. 10.6) implies that by midwinter the campaign had been in progress for a considerable time. It had ended by April 1, 71 (T. Rice Holmes, Rom. Rep. 1.161, note 2).
Cos. 122. Procos. 121, 120. See MRR 1.522, 524. The Via Domitia was named after him (cf. Cic. Font. 180), but, as Badian has shown (Mel. Piganiol 901-907), he did not organize Gallia Transalpina as a province. A milestone of the Via Domitia, found in 1949 at Pont de Treilles and inscribed Cn. Domitius Cn. f. Ahenobarbus Imperator XX, raised the suggestion that his proconsulate was prorogued until the founding of Narbo in 118, and that his triumph should be dated in that or the following year (P. M. Duval, Gallia 7, 1949, 207ff.** CRAI 1951, 161-168). But many Roman roads number their milestones from non-Roman towns, and this one, numbered from Narbo, could precede the founding of the Roman colony (Degrassi, Hommages A. Grenier 1.512-513). He might have placed a garrison there, as Sextius did at Aquae Sextiae (Badian, op. cit.). It follows that the end of his command, his triumph, and that of Fabius Allobrogicus (MRR 1.524) all precede the founding of Narbo. Pontifex?-103. The attempt of his son (RE no. 21, Cos. 96) to succeed his father in the college of lontifices is our only evidence that the consul of 122 had succeeded his father (RE no. 19, Cos. 162) as pontifex (Suet. Nero 2.1, pontificibus offensior quod alium quam se in patris sui locum cooptassent). See Sumner, Orators 97-100** above, on M. Aemilius Scaurus (140). Cos. 115** and below, on Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (21). Cos. 96.[81x]
Cos. 67. Tr. pl. 78? Keeping the mss reading # in Dio 36.41.1-2 (instead of accepting Holzl's emendation #), J.-M. David and M. Dondin date the incident when Acilius broke Lucullus' curule chair to the latter's praetorship in 78, and attribute to Acilius in that year an otherwise unattested tribunate (MEFRA 92, 1980, 199-213** cf. MRR 2.143). Censor 64? Mention in Fronto, ad Caes. 5.26 (41) and 5.27 (42), of an Acilius, censor, who imposed a nota on a tribune of the plebs, M. Lucilius, for imprisoning a Roman citizen against the judgment of his colleagues, led Borghesi to suggest that Acilius, Cos. 67, was the unknown censor, and that he was the colleague of L. Aurelius Cotta in 64 (Oeuvres completes, IV, Sull'ultima parte della serie de' censori romani, cited in C. Nicolet et al., Insula Sacra 111-112, note 3** cf. MRR 2.161). Although objection was raised that the censors of 64 were unable to complete the lection of the Senate, Suolahti (Censors 644-649) accepted that Acilius could have been censor in 64 or 61. With the discovery that L. Iulius Caesar (143). Cos. 64, was censor in 61, very probably with C. Scribonius Curio (10). Cos. 76, as his colleague (see C. Nicolet et al., Insula Sacra 149, and 84-96, 111-125), M. Dondin has made a strong case for Borghesi's suggestion (REL 57, 1979, 126-144). See below, on L. Iulius Caesar (143) and C. Scribonius Curio (10). On M. Lucilius (12), see MRR 2.470.
Leg., lieut. of Trebonius in Asia in 44-43 (Cic. Brut. 1.6.3** MRR 2.354). Report of the will of the wealthy L. Minucius Basilus (identified by Cichorius as L. Minucius L. f. Vel. in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo in 89, RS 175ff.** cf. Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 167-169), in which he adopted his nephew M. Satrius (Cic. Verr. 1.115ff:** Off. 3.73-74** Val. Max. 9.4.1), led Syme to identify Satrius with the L. Minucius Basilus (38) who was an officer under Caesar, 53-48, and praetor in 45 (MRR 2.230, 239, 268, 282, 307), and one of Caesar's assassins (App. BC 2.113** Cic. Fam. 6.15?). See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 131-RP 2.599-600. Shackleton Bailey has shown how frequently in the late Republic the original name continued to be used after adoption (Studies 101ff.), but is reversion to it in this case after regular use of the adoptive name over a considerable period so probable? Possibly this Satrius was not a Minucius Basilus at all. (TJC) Shackleton  Bailey (Studies 33-34) would distinguish also between a L. Minucius Basilus, adoptee, patron of Picene and Sabine land (Cic. Off. 3.73), also referred to as a disturber of Puteoli and Sidicinum and associate of Mark Antony in 44 (Cic. Phil. 2.107), and the L. Minucius Basilus who was an officer under Caesar, praetor in 45, and one of Caesar's assassins. How could Antony in 44 continue to associate with the latter? The relation of either with M. Satrius, above, remains obscure.
Cos. 147, 134. Procos. 146. Note an inscription from Carthage, the subject of disputes and reserves, with the statement that Sex. Classicius Secundinus, Proc. Aug. (perhaps early II A.D.) restored a damaged inscription to its ancient form. It is taken by the editors, J. Ferron and Ch. Saumagne, to be a record of Scipio's consecratio of Carthage to Adon-Baal (CRAI 1966, 61ff., and Africa 2, 1967-68, 73f.** AEpig. 1967, 546). For a parallel to Adon-Baal as the protecting god of Carthage, see the consecration of Isaura Vetus by Servilius Isauricus to sei deus, seive deast, quoius in tutela oppidum Vetus Isaura fuit (A. S. Hall, Akten VI. Internaz. Kongresses gr. u. lat. Epig. 568-571). A fragment of an inscription (ILS 67-ILLRP 326), rediscovered at Marruvium Marsorum, refers to Scipio, and confirms that it is a Hadrianic copy of an earlier text marking the gift of plunder by Scipio to the Marsi. See MRR 1.467** and J. M. Reynolds, JRS 66, 1976, 177. Leg., amb. 140-139. See MRR 2.480, 481, note 2, and 482. On the basis of the order of the fragments of Diodorus in Book 33, Astin concludes, against Cavaignac's suggestion of 143-142 as the date of this embassy, that they favor the regular dating of 140-139 (CPh 54, 1959, 221-227), but notes that spring 144 to late summer 143 is a possible space of time. See F. R. Walton's comment, in Diodorus XII, pp. 48-49, note 1 (LCL).[70x]
Cos. 67. Praetor 71. As he is termed praetor urbis in Val. Max. 7.7.5 in connection with business about an inheritance definitely within the province of the pr. urb., it seems preferable  to date his office a year earlier to 71 (cf. MRR 2.127), since in 70 M. Mummius (9) received communications from Sicily more suitable for a pr. urb. than a pr. pereg. (MRR 2.127** R. Seager, CR 20, 1970, 11** Sumner, Orators 128). Proconsul in both Gallic provinces in 66 and 65 (Larsen, CPh 26, 1931, 427-428** MRR 2.154, 159), he may have continued in charge of the Cisalpina in 64 and perhaps even into 63, as Murena was governor only of Transalpine Gaul (MRR 2.163, 169), and no successor in Cisalpina is named before Metellus Celer (86). Cos. 60, in 63 (MRR 2.166). On the governors of the Gallic provinces, see Badian, Mel. Piganiol 901ff., esp. 913-917. Caesar's prosecution of him is not certainly dated (Cic. Flacc. 98** Sall. Cat. 49.2). See Badian, Mel. Piganiol 913-916** cf. W. Allen, Jr., TAPhA 83, 1952, 233ff.** CPh 48, 1953, 176f. Addendum. As he held the office of praetor urbanus, B. W. Frier (TAPhA 113, 1983, 224-225, 229) would date it to 72, not 71 as  suggested above, thus leaving room to place the urban praetorship of L. Caecilius C. f. Q. n. Metellus (74). Cos. 68, in 71, the probable date of his grant of action for damnum vi hominibus armatis coactisve datum.
Cos. 54. Quaestor 66. See MRR 2.153. Sumner also accepts emendation of praetura to quaestura in Ascon. 45C (Orators 140). Pontifex at his death in 48 (Nic. Dam. Vit. Aug. 4** cf. MRR 254, 277, 284). He must have won it later than 57 (MRR 2.205-206). The date is usually placed before 50, and it is assumed that when he was defeated in his candidacy for the augurate in that year by M. Antonius, he was attempting to secure the honor, almost impossibly rare under the Republic, of a place in both the major colleges. Shackleton Bailey points out that in the crucial passage (Cic. Fam. 8.14.1, per iniuriam . . . ereptum [lacuna] cuius ego auctor fuerim, nunc furit) the implication is that he had been previously robbed of an honor and has just been robbed again. In the lacuna after ereptum he supplies the word pontificatum, the priesthood regular in his family, instead of the usual auguratum. Domitius had for some reason been prevented from getting it, tried to be elected as augur, and was defeated again, with Caelius' help, by M. Antonius. Nevertheless, he must have been elected to a vacant plebeian place in the college of pontifices about this time, as he was a pontifex at his death in 48. On the whole question, see Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.429-430** Illinois Class. Stud. 2, 1977, 223-228** cf. L. R. Taylor, AJPh 63, 1942, 385-412, esp. 4'04-406.
Dict. 202 (comitiorum habendorum causa). See MRR 2.316 and 318-319, and note 1. A. Aymard (REA 46, 1944, 244-257, esp. 247-254) had already advanced the suggestion made in MRR that the notices about the Ludi had been interchanged in Livy's text (30.39.4-8), but he did not accept Mommseri's view that the dictator's term ended on March 15, 201, with the end of the imperium of the consul who had named him (StR 2?.153, 160, note 4), but as he was named late in the year he could after March 15 continue until the conclusion of his six-month term. Scullard (Roman Politics 80-81, and note 1), though recognizing the rarity of examples of plebeian magistrates who had to resign because of faulty election, holds to Livy's report that the plebeian aediles of 202 held the Ludi Plebeii and the Epulum Iovis in November and then abdicated at that late date because of faulty election** the dictator, still in office on April 19, was empowered by the Senate to hold the Cerealia Ludos as the regular magistrates had not yet been elected. These Cerealia, reported in Livy under 202, were celebrated in 201. J. Jahn (Interregnum and Wahldiktatur 144-150) also holds that the dictator continued in office after the end of the consular year, and, without need of an interregnum, held in due course the elections which had been so portentously delayed by bad weather.
Some provincial cistophori of Ephesus are dated to year 13 and bear on the reverse in Latin letters the name C. Atin(ius) C. f. (see F. S. Kleiner, The Dated Cistophori of Ephesus, ANSMusN 18, 1972, 17-32, esp. 29-30** and now G. Stumpf, C. Atinius C. f., Praetor in Asia, 122-121 v. Chr. auf einem Kistophor, ZPE 61, 1985, 186-190). The era, known from later cistophori, began in 134-133 B.C., more probably, as K. J. Rigsby has shown (Phoenix 33, 1972, 39-47), with the grant of freedom to Ephesus by the will of Attalus III than from the organization of the province of Asia, while the number 13 dates this issue of cistophori to 122-121 B.C. The name in Latin letters, on the analogy of the names on later cistophori, must be that of the Roman praetorian governor of that year. This date opens the way, as Stumpf has shown, to identifying him with both the C. (Atinius) Labeo (3) (see above and MRR 2.462) named in I. Priene 121, lines 15-22 and C. Atinius Labeo Macerio (10), Tr. pl. 131 or 130 (see above). It also suggests that the Piso mentioned in I. Priene 121 may be the consul of 112, who was praetor ca. 115, that Hypsaeus may be a son of the consul of 125 and so praetor in Asia before 100, while M. Iunius Silanus Murena (170, and see above), a Murena adopted by a Iunius Silanus, held a quaestorship at the latest in the early nineties.
Pr. 44. On his name and his adoption by Q. Servilius Caepio in or before 59, see J. Geiger, Anc. Society 4, 1973, 148-150** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 129-131** and on the form of his name on Greek inscriptions of Athens, Oropos, and Delos see A. E. Raubitschek, Atti III. Congresso Internaz. gr. a lat. epig. 15-21. Monetalis. See MRR 2.442, with dates from 60 to 58, but dated by Crawford to  54 (RRC 1.455, no. 433). Quaestor, 54 or 53. Born in 85 (Cic. Brut. 229, 324, retaining with Malcovati's edition the mss reading decem** Sumner, Orators 134, note 5, and Phoenix 25, 1971, 365-366), rather late in the year (Plut. Brut. 24** App. BC 4.134** Val. Max. 1.5.7, on his birthday), he was eligible for the quaestorship of 54. Our only evidence (Auct. Vir. Ill. 82.3-4) admits either year. He refused to go to Gaul under Caesar, and went to Cilicia with his fatherin-law, Ap. Claudius Pulcher, Cos. 54. As the elections for 53 did not take place until July of that year, and Appius was eager to depart for his province (Cic. Att. 4.18.4), Brutus was more probably the quaestor with him in 54, and continued as proquaestor in 53 to 51 (MRR 2.229 for 53** see also Syme, History in Ovid 201, note 3). Proconsul and imperator, 43 and 42. In MRR 2.346f. and 361 on his coinage, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.514-518, nos. 501-508, 43-42 B.C.
Some provincial cistophori of Ephesus are dated to year 13 and bear on the reverse in Latin letters the name C. Atin(ius) C. f. (see F. S. Kleiner, The Dated Cistophori of Ephesus, ANSMusN 18, 1972, 17-32, esp. 29-30** and now G. Stumpf, C. Atinius C. f., Praetor in Asia, 122-121 v. Chr. auf einem Kistophor, ZPE 61, 1985, 186-190). The era, known from later cistophori, began in 134-133 B.C., more probably, as K. J. Rigsby has shown (Phoenix 33, 1972, 39-47), with the grant of freedom to Ephesus by the will of Attalus III than from the organization of the province of Asia, while the number 13 dates this issue of cistophori to 122-121 B.C. The name in Latin letters, on the analogy of the names on later cistophori, must be that of the Roman praetorian governor of that year. This date opens the way, as Stumpf has shown, to identifying him with both the C. (Atinius) Labeo (3) (see above and MRR 2.462) named in I. Priene 121, lines 15-22 and C. Atinius Labeo Macerio (10), Tr. pl. 131 or 130 (see above). It also suggests that the Piso mentioned in I. Priene 121 may be the consul of 112, who was praetor ca. 115, that Hypsaeus may be a son of the consul of 125 and so praetor in Asia before 100, while M. Iunius Silanus Murena (170, and see above), a Murena adopted by a Iunius Silanus, held a quaestorship at the latest in the early nineties.
Cos. 43. He was in Rome in 48 and early 47 (Cic. Au. 11.6.3, and 14.3), and issued coins in 48. In MRR 2.455, and Index, 634, note Crawford, RRC 1.464-465, no. 449, 48 B.C. The suggestion in MRR 2.258, 49 B.C., that he was an aed. pl. that,year, since it was based on the coins, should be withdrawn. But against Dio's statement that there were then no aediles in the city (41.36.2), note Cicero's remark in Att. 9.12.3, March 20: aediles ludos parant. As to an aedileship in 48, Crawford remarks: The coins provide no evidence that he was an aedile. But Sumner grants that, being present in Rome, he may have had some magistracy (Phoenix 25, 1971, 255). As to the possibility of a praetorship, Sumner has shown that under Caesar his proconsulship in Bithynia and Pontus in 47 and 46 is no proof that he had been a praetor before it (Sumner, op. cit.** see also Badian, Phoenix 25, 1971, 141). Procos. Cisalpine Gaul, 45-44. He left the city paludatus on December 30, 45 (Cic. Fam. 15.17.3), but must have remained near since he was still about on March 7, 45 (Att. 12.14.4), and did not set out to succeed Brutus until March 15 (Att. 12.19.3). See Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.378. On his public burial after his death while consul in war against Antony in 43, add in MRR 2.336, references to CIL 6.37077-ILS 8890-ILLRP 421.[220x]
Pr. 194. Procos. Spain, 200-196. See MRR 1.326, note 4, 328, 329, note 3, 331, 333, 336. On his command and his ovatio in 196, see Sumner, Phoenix 19, 1965, 24-26, with a new reading of lines 2 and 3 of Fast. Triumph. Cap. for 196 (which I confirmed on the stone in 1967), and Arethusa 3, 1970, 90-92. For the precedent of an ovatio celebrated by one who has not been dictator, consul, or praetor, see L. Cornelius Lentulus (188). Cos. 199, in 200 (Liv. 31.20.1-6** MRR 2.324). Sumner (ibid. 93-97) holds that there were still in 196 (Liv. 32.28.2) no separate territorial arrangements with boundaries between the provinces Ult. and Cit. and thus explains the confusion regarding the provinces in which M. Helvius (MRR 2.336, 341), C. Sempronius Tuditanus before his death (2.333, 337), and Q. Minucius Thermus (2.335, 341) were operating. See R. C. Knapp, Aspects of the Roman Experience in Iberia, 206-100 B.C 92-94, and notes 19-20, with a good defense of the traditional arrangement. Leg., amb. 196. In MRR 1.337, 339, note 2, 1 considered the consular Cn. Cornelius (Lentulus) (21, 176) a more probable choice as member of the commission of ten in 196 than Cn. Cornelius Blasio, who was not yet a praetor, but Schleussner (Legaten 24, note 48) has pointed out that this was true of another member, L. Stertinius (MRR 1.338).
Cos. 89. Quaestor ca. 106. After his quaestorship under T. Albucius (2) in Sardinia, he attempted to prosecute his former commander but was refused (Cic. Div. In Caec. 63** MRR 1.560, 562, note 1** Gruen, RPCC 171-173** Sumner, Orators 77, 80). The date usually suggested for his quaestorship is ca. 104, with Albucius? praetorship in 105, followed by his command in Sardinia (MRR 1.560). Badian however notes that Pompeius Strabo was the prosecutor of Fabius Maximus Eburnus for putting his son to death and caused him to retire into exile (Oros. 5.15.8** cf. Val. Max. 6.1.5, naming Servilianus, who was  never censor** Ps.-Quintil., Decl. 3.17, naming Eburnus** Gruen, TAPhA 95, 1964, 101-106** RPCC 171-173** Badian, Klio 66, 1984, 306-309). From the phrase die dicta in Orosius (5.16.8) Badian infers that Strabo accused Eburnus before the people as tribune of the plebs. The date is probably 104, so Strabo?s quaestorship may be placed no later than 106, and his tribunate, not otherwise attested, in 104. Praetor ca. 92. His praetorship may be dated to 94 or 93, as 92 is merely the latest legal date, and his probable command in Macedonia as promagistrate to the next year (IG_ 3.4101-SIG? 701, note** see M. Gelzer, Kl. Schr. 2.109-110** Pompeius 27** and on Macedonia, F. Papazoglou, ANRW 2.7.1, 1980, 310).[165x]
Cos. 92. Monetalis. In MRR 2.435, and Index, 547, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.313, no. 300, 110 or 109 B.C. Sumner notes that as his quaestorship is listed before the post of IIIvir monetalis in his inscription (ILS 45), Crawford's dating creates an unusually long, though not impossible date between the quaestorship and the consulship (ca. 110 to 92** Sumner, Orators 100-101). Cicero notes that he did not hold the higher offices suo anno (Off. 2.59** cf. 57). In a mistaken interpretation of Cic. Verr. 2.4.6, Drumann-Groebe (.2.156, no. 28) attributed to him a command in Sicily after his praetorship in 95. But the text shows only that he was a patron of Messana and hospes of the family of the Heii, from whom he borrowed, and returned promptly, an Eros of Praxiteles for his aedilician games in 99. An inscription of Cyrene honoring him  as patron when he was consul (#** see L. Gasperini, QAL 5** 1967, 53-57) is taken in AEpig. 1967, no. 532, to signify that he was proconsul there in 91 after his consulship, at a time before 75-74 when there was as yet no province of Cyrene. He was probably concerned with the lands bequeathed by Ptolemy Apion in 96 (J. M. Reynolds, JRS 61, 1971, 140** and JRS 52, 1962, 97-103, on the organization of the province). See Badian, Phoenix 25, 1971, 134-137.[57x]
Cos. 137. Pr. by 140. See MRR 1.480. Mancinus presided, almost certainly as praetor urbanus in the absence of the consuls, over the Senate at the passage of the SC de Narthaciensibus et Melitaensibus (SIG? 674** Sherk, RDGE 49-53, no. 9). Dittenberger dated this before 147 because Thessaly was not at the time of the decree under a provincial regime, which presumably began in 146. In IG 9.2, p. xxiv, however, the Thessalian officials named in the decree are dated toward 140, even though the inscription itself (no. 89) is dated before 146. Stahelin pointed out that the names of the officials make the later date mandatory (Philologus 88, 1933, 130-132, and RE s. v. Narthakion** cf. also G. Daux, BCH 57, 1933, 57), while S. Accame has shown that this part of Greece remained independent and the settlement of Flamininus remained valid in Thessaly after 146 (Dominio Romano 15, 217-225). Mancinus' praetorship** therefore, need not precede 146, and should probably be placed ca. 140 at the regular interval before his consulship in 137. See Sherk, RDGE no. 9, pp. 49-53. Consul 137. See MRR 1.484, 486, on Scaevola, and 487, on Rutilius: according to Pomponius in Digest 50.7.18 (cf. Auct. Vir. Ill. 59) his citizenship was restored later by a special law and he was elected to the praetorship.[103x]
, Leg., lieut? 90. Muènzer (no. 248) points out that traces of two Valerii Messallae appear in office in the generations between the consul of 161 (no. 253) and the consul of 61 (no. 266)A Valerius Messalla was prosecuted by Metellus Numidicus, probably early in the latter's career (so Syme, see below), for offenses against socii (Gell. 15.14.1). Syme (JRS 45, 1955, 158?RP 1.265) suggests that Potitus Valerius Messalla, cos. Buff. in 29 and procos. in Asia, was honored at Magnesia as a patron and benefactor # (OGIS 460** cf. A. E. Gordon, Potitus Valerius Messalla 43f.), and was probably a son of the consul of 53 (no. 268)** the defendant mentioned above was probably an ancestor of these and of the consul of 61. On the basis of the filiation of the consul of 61 (M. f. M'. n.), Syme suggests that his name was M'. Valerius Messalla and that he was a grandfather of the consul of 61. He might have been governor of Asia ca. 120, but Mènzer inclined toward a more recent date. Mènzer remains uncertain whether he should be distinguished from the legate of 90 (no. 249), who might be his son. The latter, who is listed in Appian as one of the most distinguished men (BC 1.40), probably attained the praetorship. The entries in the Index (2.630) should read as follows:
Praetor 196. See MRR 1.335, 339, note 2. Noting that although Buteo was assigned the province of Hisp. Ult. he appears to have had no further career (Liv. 33.24.2 and 26.4), Sumner suggests that he, and not Q. Fabius Maximus, was the augur who was inaugurated in 203 (Liv. 30.26.9) and died in 196 (33.42.6). The augur could not be the son of the Cunctator (Cos. 213), who died before him (a laudatio funebris by his father, Cic., Brut. 12** Fam. 4.6.1** cf. RE no. 103), and is usually taken to be his grandson. Identification with Q. Fabius Buteo would explain Buteo's inactivity (but not mention of legionem quam Q. Fabius habuerat [Liv. 33.43.7], which was assigned to his successor Ap. Claudius in 195) and the appearance of another Q. Fabius Maximus (105), Pr. 181 (Liv. 40.18.2** MRR 1.384). The augur who died in 196 is not described as praetor or pr. desig. but as admodum adulescens priusquam ullum magistratum caperet (33.42.6). For Sumner this is a garbled account of his death before he could assume his command. Hence his lack of a career in Spain, and the retention of Helvius in command. In this Sumner is correcting Livy at several points which are most likely to depend ultimately upon archival material. See Sumner, Arethusa 3, 1970, 85-102.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.450, and Index, 608, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.407, no. 394, 74 B.C. He was perhaps the candidate in 63 for the praetorship of 62, Postumus (RE no. 4** cf. Cic. Mur. 57), named in Cicero, Pro Murena, whom Sumner took to be a Postumius Albinus and a relative of Postumia, wife of Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the unsuccessful candidate for the consulship of 62 and later consul in 51 (Phoenix 25, 1971, 254, note 26** cf. Orators 144-145). Shackleton Bailey notes that identification of the monetalis C. Postumius with the candidate Postumus (the praenomen does not appear in the manuscript tradition of the Pro Murena) requires emendation of forms of Postumus to forms of Postumius in four out of five passages (Mur. 54, 56, 57a, 69). While he agrees that Postumia's name is a strong argument in favor of considering the praetorian candidate to be a Postumius Albinus, he would reject it, but in spite of the many emendations required in the Pro Murena, he is inclined to agree with Sumner in identifying the monetalis of 74 with Postumus (Postumius) the candidate of 63. See below, on L.? Postumius (15)** Sumner, Orators 144145** cf. Phoenix 25, 1971, 254, note 26** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.310** Studies 58-60** HSPh 83, 1979, 257-259.[171x]
The other, P. f., son of the tribune of 88, legate of Caesar attested in 55, 52, and 49 (Caes. BG 4.22.6** 7.90.7** BC 1.74.6**  MRR 2.219, 239, 269), was probably a quaestor before his service with Caesar, saw active service while praetor in 48 (Caes. BC 3.101** MRR 2.273), and was acclaimed imperator while in command in Illyricum in 47-46 (Cic. Fam. 13.77** note the correction required in MRR 2.299). Censor 42. P. Sulpicius P. f. was most probably Caesar's officer, the praetor of 48 (RE no. 93** see MRR 2.358-359).
Praetor 49. Legatus in Sicily, probably after being quaestor (by 59, MRR 2.190, but see above, on Q. Caecilius Metellus Scipio [99]) (ILS 879-ILLRP 398). See Syme, MH 15, 1958, 53** Wiseman, NM 231, no. 173. The date of his aedileship (MRR 2.235, 240, note 2) may be either 53 or 52. Dio (40.45.1) reports that F., while aedile, was put in prison by the tribune Q. Pompeius Rufus (41), who entered office on December 10, 53, and so could have attacked F. in either year. Plutarch (Cat. Min. 46) places his aedileship after the anarchy of late 54 and the first half of 53 but before the violence in late 53 and early 52 caused by the consular candidates for 52. Amyot's emendation of # in Plut. Cat. Min. to # has made a colleague out of Curio, who was preparing sumptuous funeral games in honor of his father, but Curio was then, or at least until late in 53, if not into 52, absent in Asia as proquaestor with C. Claudius Pulcher (MRR 2.224, 230), and after his return was planning to be a candidate for the plebeian aedileship of 50 (Cic. Fam. 8.9.3** 8.8.10). See above, on M. Aufidius Lurco (25, cf. 27). Curio had not returned when Cicero was elected an augur, but precise information on Favonius remains lacking. See J. Linderski, HSPh 76, 1972, 181-200.[90x]
Cos. 182, 168. Procos. 190, 189. The title Imp(erator) in the inscription of Lascuta, which is dated a. d. XII K. Febr. (CIL 1_.2.644-ILS 15-ILLRP 514) places his victory in the consular year 190. E. Meyer (Erasmus 6, nos. 13-14, 480) points out that his imperium was not formally prorogued for 189. He was assigned the command in Farther Spain while praetor in 191 but with twelve lictors and imperium pro consule (Plut. Aem. 4.1). Jashemski correctly notes that throughout this period the governors of Spain were sent as praetors except in some emergencies, but held proconsular imperium (Origin and History of the Proconsular and Propraetorian Imperium to 27 B. C. 25, 41-50** cf. R. C. Knapp, Aspects of the Roman Experience in Iberia, 206-100 RC 94). On the subject of praetors with consular imperium both in and after their year as praetors, see the convincing comments of R. E. Smith, Service in the Post-Marian Army 11-16, esp. 13, note 2, and thereafter on individual provinces. A. H. McDonald offers as an explanation of the inconsistencies in Livy's record of the titles that one source treated them as praetors and another as proconsuls (JRS 43, 1953, 143- 144** and note his references to Kahrstedt and Klotz, ibid.).[9x]
Aed. pl. 64? Mèunzer, after first rejecting the identification of the colleague of C. Octavius in the aedileship, ca. 64, with C. Turranius (4), Pr. 44, reversed his position in his article in RE on the latter. Valerius Maximus (9.11.5, Toranius), Orosius (6.18.9, Thoranius), and Appian (BC 4.18, #) all refer to an aged ex- praetor who was proscribed and killed. There is no evidence that the colleague of C. Octavius attained the praetorship, but Suetonius (Aug. 27.1) reports that Octavian proscribed C. Toranius, his guardian and his father's colleague in the aedileship, while Appian (BC 4.12) refers to the same event and gives the name #. Against his identification there are also the mss tradition of Cic. Phil. 3.25 (Turranius) and the long interval between an aedileship in 64 and a praetorship in 44. Despite Willems (Senat 1.566, cf. 466, no. 105), the notices regarding the ex-praetor should be referred to C. Turranius (4) and the others to C. Toranius (4). Conceivably C. Toranius could have held a praetorship, but if so Suetonius ignores it. Nor is it probable that the Toranius to whom Cicero sent a letter of encouragement in 45 (Fam. 6.20 and 21) received a praetorship in 44. (RS, CP** TJC) See also Wiseman, NM 267, no. 439.
Cos. 57. In his filiation in Fast. Cap. (Degrassi, Inscr. Ital. 13.1.131, and plate 37, fragment 39) P. f. is clear but at the break in the stone a small part of a letter is visible which Degrassi read as C. n., thus securing P. f. C. n. Wiseman and Crawford, after renewed inspection of the stone, reject the C and read L, with the resulting filiation P. f: L. n. (Crawford, RRC 1.409, no. 397, 74 B.C.** Wiseman, rev. of Sumner, Orators, JRS 65, 1975, 198). Sumner noted on the basis of the coinage the possibility of identification with P. Lentulus P. f. L. n. (204), quaestor urbanus in 74, but kept Degrassi's construction in the stemma (Orators 142-143). The new filiation makes it possible to identify the quaestor of 74 (204) with the consul of 57 and to recognize him as a brother of Lentulus Crus (218). Cos. 49. See Crawford, loc. cit., on the coinage as quaestor, which Mattingly (NC 16, 1956, 199-200) would date to 70. Procos. in Cilicia, 56-53. See MRR 2.210. On his arrangements in Cyprus, there is mention of a Lex Cornelia (Cic. Fam. 13.48** cf. Att. 5.21.6** Badian, JRS 55, 1965, 113, and note 26** A. J. Marshall, Cicero's Letter to Cyprus, Phoenix 18, 1964, 206-215).[69]
Adopted by C. Rabirius, perduellionis reus, and himself still an eques when prosecuted de repetundis in 54, he cannot be identified with the C. Postumus (Postumius?) who was a candidate for the praetorship of 63. His career as a senator began in 49 (Cic. Fam. 2.6.7** Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 254** cf. Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.495), nor need he have been a praetor in 48, as Sumner has shown (op. cit.) before becoming proconsul in Asia in 47, but Cicero's satirical remark about a consular candidacy in 45 (Att. 12.49.2) makes it seem probable. On his proconsulate, see I. de Delos 4.1.1859?CIL 1_.773?ILLRP 399, where Degrassi suggests a date in 45 (but see below)** cf. Joseph. AJ 14.241, where Homolle emended # in the text to #, and # to # (Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 134). He might have been proconsul in Asia in 48 after Pharsalus and before the arrival of Servilius Isauricus in 46 since the title and authority of Domitius Calvinus, though wide and general (Bell. Alex. 34.1: Asiam finitimasque provincias) is not fully defined (cf. Magie, RRAM 2.1586). He appears in Africa in 46 with Caesar, probably as a legatus (MRR 2.302). On his career, see Dessau, Hermes 46, 1911, 613-620** 47, 1912, 320.
Tr. pl. 69? The holding of this office depends on identifying Varro with the author of the Lex Visellia and the date of his office with the date of the law, which must in any case precede the year of the tribunes listed in 68 (MRR 2.138-139). Curule aedile and Iudex quaestionis. The texts cited in MRR 2.189 and 195 show that Visellius Varro and C. Licinius Murena were aediles together but do not give a date. As a tr. Mil. under C. Claudius Nero in Asia in 80-79 (MRR 2.81) and a recent quaestorius when witness to the SC de Oropiis in 73 (2.115), Varro would be at the proper age for an aedileship by 67 or 66 rather than the 59 of MRR and Seidl, Fast. Aed. 62. According to Cicero (Brut. 264) he died while iudex quaestionis the year after he was ledile. C. Licinius Murena (119), younger brother of the consul of 62, could easily have been of aedilician age by 67 or 66 (Sumner, Orators 138-139). But some delay is still possible, and the legal expert and cousin of Cicero may be the Visellius who drew up in late 58 for the incoming tribune Fadius a draft of a law for Cicero?s recall (Cic. Att. 3.23.4), and the aedileship in 59 and the office of iudex quaestionis in 58 may be accepted.
Cos. 58. His career from aedileship to consulship advanced, like Cicero's, sine repulsa (Cic. Pis. 2). His quaestorship, aedileship, and praetorship may therefore be attributed to the normal years, 70, 64, and 61, resp. (TJC** on the intervals, see Badian, Studies 145-146). He was perhaps proconsul of Hisp. Cit. ca. 60-59 after his praetorship (Syme, Piso and Veranius in Catullus Class. & Med. 17, 1956, 129-134-RP.1.300-304), and so, perhaps, open to prosecution de repetundis by P. Clodius (still Claudius then) (Val. Max. 8.1.6** cf. Gruen, LGRR 529, and Athenaeum 49, 1971, 56), and was acquitted. See also Nicolet, et al., Insula Sacra 59-60. Consul 58. In MRR 2.193, refer also on Macedonia to Cic. Att. 3.1** and to ILLRP 423, 424. Procos. Macedonia 57-55. See MRR 2.207, 210, 218. Notices in Fast. Amitern. and Fast. Allifani date the dedication of Pompey's theater to August 12, 55 (MRR 2.214). As Cicero's in Pisonem was delivered only a few days before (Cic. Pis. 65** Ascon. 1C and 15-16C), this points to Piso's return about June. His complaint against Cicero in the Senate soon followed, and Cicero's reply by early August (B. A. Marshall, CQ 25, 1975, 88-93).
Cos. 37, 28, 27. In RE, see also 9A.1, Nachtr•ge 1226-1275. Tr. pl. Niccolini's conjecture (FTP 356f.) that Agrippa and Cornificius prosecuted Cassius and Brutus, respectively, for Caesar's murder under the Pedian law as tribunes of the plebs is not a necessary one since the trial took place in a quaestio (Plat. Brut. 27.3-5** cf. Vell. 2.69.5). There is no doubt that Agrippa held the office, but the statement in Servius (ad Aen. 8.682, et tribunus plebi quietissimus fait et post tertium consul) points to later and quieter years than 43. (RS, CP) On the trials see Mon. Ancyr. 1.2** Plut. Brut. 27** Liv. Per. 120** Suet. Nero 3.1** Galba 3.2** App. BC 3.95, 5.48** Dio 46.48-49, 47.22.4. See MRR 2.340-341. Proconsul 40-38. His victory over the  Aquitani may by placed in 38 (App. BC 5.92** Dio 48.49.3** Eutrop. 7.5), and after it his crossing of the Rhine and his dealings with the Ubii (see M. Reinhold, Marcus Agrippa 26-27, and note 34). On his coinage (with Octavian, Imp. Caesar Divi Iuli f.) as cos. desig. for 37, see Crawford, RRC 1.535, no. 534, 38 B.C. Aedile 33. In MRR 2.415, refer also to Hor. Sat. 2.3.185. See M. Reinhold, Marcus Agrippa 47-52** Wiseman, NM 275, no. 497.
Cos. 42. Since he was a legate of Caesar in 54 (MRR 2.226), he presumably had held the quaestorship by 55. He appears again in 49 in command of the legiones Fabianae in Spain (Caes. BC 1.40.5** MRR 2.268), and again as a legatus under Caesar in Africa (Bell. Afr. 4.1** cf. Cic. Fam. 13.29). He was one of Caesar?s appointees as praefectus urbi in 45 (MRR 2.313** A. Alfåldi, Mel. Seston 1-13** and on his coins, see Crawford, RRC 1.485, no. 475). If he was praetor at all (his praetorship is unattested), he held the office before the end of 45, as he was proconsul in Cisalpine Gaul in 44 (MRR 2.329) and consul in 42 (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 360). Sumner suggests that he may have been one of the three-month praetors of 47 (ibid. 359-360), a suitable point for it in his known career. Procos. in Gallia Comata 44-43. In MRR 2.348, on the founding of Lugdunum (October 11, 43), see P. Wuilleumier, Fouilles de Fourviere** and Lyon, Metropole des Gaules 12ff., citing the works of A. Audin. T. Munatius Plancus Bursa (32), tr. Pl. 52, termed frater in Ascon. 32C, may have been a cousin (Shackleton Bailey, Onom.** see Gnomon 56, 1984, 179, note 1).[146]
Cos. 76. A fragment of an inscription of Thasos containing a letter of Sulla and a copy of an SC yields among the witnesses the name of the consul of 76 (Dunant and Pouilloux, Etudes Thas. 5.2.37-45, no. 174) with part of the name of the tribe ( ...#, with a vertical stroke barely visible before the e). From this and a review of the manuscript tradition for the senatorial decrees in Cic. Fam. 8.8.5-6, with the name of his son, Curio (11), Tr. pl. 50 (Pop. in the first SC, Porn. in the second), Badian has shown that the tribe was the Pomptina (Athenaeum 40, 1962, 356-359). See L. R. Taylor, VDRR 268** Sherk., RDGE 115-118, no. 20. Censor 61. Granting that L. Caesar is the correct reading of the name in line 22 of the Lex Gabinia Calpurnia de Delo (see above, Iulius, no. 143, Cos. 64), the only other suitable ex-consul whose name can be presented in the small remaining space (and only as C. Curio even then) is the consul of 76 (C. Nicolet et al., Insula Sacra, esp. 122-125). This is supported by Cic. 0,f: 2.17** the joke in Att. 1.16.3** and Val. Max. 2.7.5** 2.9.pr** 9.1.7. See the review of possible candidates in Suolahti, Censors 664-672.
Cos. 251, 247. Xvir agris dandis 232? In the laudatio pronounced by his son, Q. Metellus (81), membership on a land commission is included among his achievements (Pliny, NH 7.139- 140). J. H. Corbett suggests that the most probable occasion was the viritane assignment of Ager Gallicus under the law of Flaminius in 232 (MRR 1.225), even though there is no mention of the appointment of a commission under this law (CR 20,,1970, 7-8). Pontifex. In spite of Pliny's description of the pontifex who dedicated the temple of Ops Opifera as hesitant in speech (NH 11.174) and the consul of 251 as clear and faultless (NH 7.140** cf. Val. Max. 8.13.1** Cic. Sen. 30), M. G. Morgan rejects Metellus Delmaticus, Cos. 119, in favor of the Cos. of 251, pontifex and pontifex maximus, and victor over the Carthaginians at Panormus when proconsul in 250 (Phoenix 27, 1973, 35-41). By reconciling Polybius 2.39.14-15 and 2.41.2, he brings support. to the argument for dating that victory to his proconsulship early in 250 (CQ 22, 1972, 123-129** MRR 2.213). On the elephant coinage, see now Crawford, RRC 1.287, no. 262, 128 B.C., and below on nos. 93 and 91.
Pr. 68. Legatus of Sulla, 82-80. Maurenbrecher applies the fragment from Festus (210L) in Sall. Hist. 1.46M, magnis operibus perfectis obsidium cepit (read coepit) per L. Catilinam legatum, to the siege of Praeneste in 82, but Keaveney and Strachan have shown that it may also be applied to another siege in the period, such as those of Nola or Aesernia (cf. Liv. Per. 89** Gran. Lic. 36.8-9, p. 25 Criniti** CQ 31, 1981, 363-366). Propr. Africa 67-66. See MRR 2.147, 155. Sumner accepts the implication of Sall. Cat. 18.2-3 that Catiline's candidacy for the consulship of 65 was not in the original election (he was probably still in Africa  then) but in the supplementary election after the original victors had been convicted of ambitus. He notes that his professio was refused by Volcatius and his consilium because he had not been able to make it intra legitimos dies (Sall. loc. cit.** cf. Ascon. 89C** Dio 36.43.3-4** R. Seager, Historia 13, 1964, 338-339). He was perhaps trying to anticipate the prosecution de repetundis which eventuated the next year. In MRR 2.155, refer also to Cic. Cael. 10 on his trial. See Sumner, Phoenix 19, 1965, 226-231.
The monetalis (14) is dated by Crawford, RRC 1.414, no. 404, to 70 B.C.** see MRR 2.455 for earlier datings. He may be identified with T. Vettius (11), quaestor under Verres in Sicily in 72 and probably 71, based on Syracuse (Cic. Verr. 2.3.168** 2.5.135, esp. 114** see N. Marinone, AAT 100, 1965- 1966, 219-252, esp. 230-231). He is taken to be the praetor in 59 (14) who presided over the trial of C. Valerius Flaccus in the quaestio de repetundis (Cic. Flacc. 85), and was proconsul in Africa the next year (MRR 2.189, but with a query added, and 198). Gruen doubts this since L. Lucullus, addressed in the same passage, was there only as a juror. Vettius too may be no more than a juror and his legacy in Africa no more than an inheritance from a previous governorship (Latomus 32, 1973, 308, note 10). The point at issue is the propriety of getting profits while governor, and the tenses of venerit, amittes, and retinebis imply a future event in Africa, so it seems preferable to consider Vettius the coming governor of Africa, and his present position a praetorship. See Shackleton Bailey, HSPh 83, 1979, 261, on Cic. Flacc. 85.
Cos. 77. As consul he commanded considerable  military forces (Cic. Cluent. 99: legati et praefecti et tribuni militates), but there is no evidence, although Transalpine and Cisalpine Gaul were apparently available, that he went on to a provincial command (Sumner, JRS 54, 1964, 47** Badian, Mel. Piganiol 2.912-913). Sumner has shown that Mamercus, rather than Marcus or Manius (62). Cos. 66, was very probably one of the principes civitatis qui plurimum in senatu poterant who were hostile witnesses against C. Cornelius in 65 (JRS 54, 1964, 41-48** see Ascon. 60C** contra, M. T. Griffin, JRS 63, 1973, 213** Syme, Ten Papers in Tacitus 31, note 5, and 141). Princeps senatus 70. On the possibility that he was chosen princeps senatus by the censors of 70, see MRR 2.130, note 1 (deleting the word insignificant and adding a reference to Mommsen, StR 3.970 and 975, note 2, where he retracts his earlier view in RF 1.92-94).  He might be an unknown censor of 64 (Suolahti, Censors 661-663** Sumner, loc. cit. 47-48), but see above on  M'. Acilius Glabrio (38). Cos. 67. On his name, see Sumner, Orators 64-67.[8x]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.446, and Index, 590, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.320- 321, no. 313, 106 B.C. Tr. Pl. 89? See MRR 2.34, 38, note 4. The title Tribune of the Plebs depends on the reading of the text of fr. 44P2 of Sisenna?s Histories, and being from Book III refers to 90 in any case, not to 89. The text runs as follows: Lucium Memmium socerum Gai Scriboni, tribunum plebis quem Marci Livi consiliarium fuisse callebant et tunc Curionis oratorem. It seems strange for Memmius to be tribune in the same year with his son-in-law, the future consul of 76. As long ago as 1834, C. L. Roth suggested reading tribuni plebis, now accepted by Frassinetti, Athenaeum 50, 1972, 78-118, esp. 90. Sumner independently suggests too that the original text had the abbreviation tr. Pl. and that this title referred to Scribonius (Orators 89-90** cf. Wiseman, CQ 17, 1967, 164-167). He may be identified with the monetalis L. Memmius (13), above** in all probability too young to be the distinguished senator who visited Egypt in 112 (RE no. 12** MRR 1.539). The word consiliarium evinces continued activity, but there is no evidence of magistracies.
Cos. 83. As 103 seems the most probable date for his tribunate (MRR 1.563-564, 565, note 7), ending on December 10 of that year, his quaestorship under M. Antonius, if he served in the war against the Cilician pirates, should best be dated to 101, thus avoiding an overlap in offices, but he . may have been the consul?s quaestor in 99. Mènzer (Hermes 67, 1932, 220-236) admitted both possibilities but favored the earlier date because Norbanus sought refuge at Rhodes when proscribed by Sulla (Liv. Per. 89** Oros. 5.21.3). Gruen prefers the later date (CPh 61, 1966, 105-106) because the quaestor Gabinius served in Rhodes. A date to 99, as Sumner observes, reduces the interval to his consulship to 16 years. See Badian,  Studies 343ff. and 230** AJPh 104, 1983, 156-171. The dates in MRR for his praetorship and his promagistracy in Africa (MRR 2.41, note 3, 88 and 87) should be revised at least to 89 and 88-87, since, according to Diodorus (37.2.13) and Cicero ( Verr. 2.3.117, 2.5.8), he held command there during the Social War. See Badian, Studies 84-86. He may have remained into the period of Cinna?s consulships.[149]
Cos. 93. Praetor 96. In MRR 2.9 add that he was praetor urbanus (Cic. Balb. 55). Procos. Spain 92, Gaul 85? to 81. His command in Spain may have included both provinces and apparently continued without interruption until his return in 81. Gallia Transalpina may have been added as  early as 85, but for some years the evidence is lacking (see MRR 2.58 and 60, note 3, but especially Badian, PACA 1, 1958, 11-15-Studies 88-93** Mel. Piganiol 908). On his coinage while proconsul in Gaul, see  Crawford, RRC 1.379-381, no. 365, 82 B.C.** Cf. MRR 2.59-60. Crawford sees an association between this issue and Sulla's first moves against Sertorius in Spain. Flaccus' command in Nearer Spain, and his acclamation as imperator, is attested in the recently discovered Tabula Contrebiensis, dated to 87, with the words Iudicium addeixit C. Valerius C. f. Flaccus Imperator (C. Valerius C. f. Flaccus, Imperator, established the judgment). See J. S. Richardson, JRS 73, 1983, 33-41, for text, discussion, and previous bibliography. See also C. Ebel, Phoenix 29, 1975, 363** his province included only western Transalpina.
Pr. 45. Described as an adulescens when in command of forces under Caesar in 56 and 52 (MRR 2.213, 239), he was probably not then a senator, but since he was legatus in 49 (MRR 2.267) he had probably been a quaestor in 50 (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 358-359** Syme, RP 3.1240). Crawford dates the minting of coinage by Brutus in Rome to 48 (RRC 1.466-467, nos. 450-451). If this is correct, his command in Transalpine Gaul (MRR 2.284, 291, 301) should be placed in 47 and 46. As in other appointments made in Caesar's brief first dictatorship (App. BC 2.48), Decimus Brutus too may have been a proconsul (Badian, Phoenix 25, 1971, 140-141** cf. MRR 2.281). Sumner remarks that a praetorship in 45 (it could be only in the latter part of the year) is highly reasonable, since it falls between commands in Transalpine Gaul in 47-46 and in Cisalpine Gaul in 44-43 (loc. cit.). Under Caesar he was designated consul for 42. He was a son of D. Iunius Brutus, Cos. 77, adopted by a Postumius Albinus (Shackleton Bailey, Studies 118). On his nomenclature see Shackleton Bailey, ibid., and Onom.
Quaestor 57? Caelius' curule aedileship in 50 and his praetorship in 48 suggest that, unless he had won some special exemption, he was born in 88 and Pliny (NH 7.165) is mistaken in making him and Calvus the same age. His quaestorship is not explictly mentioned, and Austin thinks it was omitted (Pro Caelio, App. 1), but this office, almost without exception, was the beginning of a senatorial career in the first century, whatever insignia or distinctions his successful prosecution of the consular C. Antonius may have given him. As Sumner has noted, Cicero states that he was already at the age for candidacy in 58 (Cael. 18, cum ... per aetatem magistratus petere posset), and in 56 the hinting of his prosecutors that he had engaged in ambitus (Cael. 78) is consistent at least with candidacy in 59 or 58. See Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 247-248** Orators 146-147. But Cicero's silence regarding it is strange, and the possibility of an exemption remains. See H. E. Russell, Advancement in Rank under the Republic as a Reward for the Soldier and the Public Prosecutor (Diss. Bryn Mawr College, 1950, microfilm).
Praetor. Proconsul in Macedonia (ca. 143?), who built and named the Via Egnatia (C. Romiopoulou, BCH 98, 1974, 813-866** AEpig. 1976, no. 643, a bilingual inscription near Thessalonica** cf. 1973, no. 492** cf. P. Collart, BCH 100, 1976, 177-200, esp. 182-183** F. Papazoglou, ANRW 2.7.1, 1979, 310). For a Cn. Egnatius C. f who might be the same man, see Sherk, RDGE 34, no. 4, but note the date, 175-160 B.C. However, H. B. Mattingly's convincing dating of this inscription to the late 140s makes the identification practically certain (NC 1969, 103-104** cf. Crawford, RRC 1.239-241, no. 189). See now F. W. Walbank, The Original Extent of the Via Egnatia, LCM 2, 1977, 73-74. *(Cn.) Egnatius (Cn. f. Cn. n. Maximus) (2), Senator. A juror in 74 in the trial of Oppianicus, whose father[84x] disinherited him for accepting bribes (Cic. Cluent. 135, Egnatius). The description of the father as Cn. Egnatius pater indicates that both had the same praenomen, and the son should be distinguished from the monetalis (see below, no. 27). See Syme, Historia 4, 1955, 61?RP 1.280-281** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 36.
Augur 203. See MRR 1.314, 203 B.C., and 338, 196 B.C. Sumner, in Arethusa 3, 1970, 96-98, suggests that Livy's mistake in 30.26.10 arose not from accepting the new augur as a son of the Cunctator (he had died before his father) rather than a grandson, but in interpreting Q. Fabius M. f. in the records as Q. Fabius Maximus. Q. Fabius M. f. (57) was a Buteo, son of the consul of 245, M. Fabius Buteo. He was elected praetor for 196 (MRR 1.335), and assigned a command in Hisp. Ult. of which there is no further notice. 1n fact, M. Helvius was continued in Hisp. Ult. into 195, detained according to Livy by illness (MRR 1.336, cf. 343), while the augur, called Q. Fabius Maximus by Livy (33.42.6) but really Q. Fabius Buteo in Sumner's reconstruction, died while still young before he could attain a magistracy. Sumner sees in Helvius' prolonged command in Spain less the result of his illness (note his victories and his ovatio in 185) than of the death of his intended successor. He finds a grandson of the Cunctator in Q. Fabius Maximus (105), praetor in 181. See above on Q. Fabius Buteo (57)
Pr. 89. Starting with the possibility that the Lex Plautia Papiria was passed late in 89, Badian has raised the question whether the three praetors who are recorded as registering citizens under it, Ap. Claudius Pulcher (296), Q. Caecilius Metellus (98), and P. Gabinius (13), did not hold office in 88. He notes that Cicero's argument uses only these three, and that at least two of those in 88, Junius Brutus (51) and Servilius (3), were removed from office (see MRR 2.40-41), while the rest are of uncertain date. If P. Gabinius was praetor in 88, he could have succeeded Sentius in Macedonia, and by his conduct there have incurred prosecution by the Achaeans (Cic. Div. in Caec. 64** cf. Arch. 9). The length of his term there is quite uncertain: perhaps, with Sulla's backing, until Cornelius Dolabella (134) came in 80 (MRR 2.80). But there is no doubt of the command there of Scipio Asiagenes (338) in 85, and his conflict with Illyrian and Thracian tribes. See Badian, PACA 1, 1958, 5-6-Studies 74-82. A. Keaveney argues convincingly in favor of a date in 89 for these praetorships (Eranos 81, 1983, 47-51).
His praetorship in 46 (MRR 2.295) is simply an inference from his proconsulate in Sicily in 45 (Cic. Fam. 6.9** 8.3), insufficient for proof, as Sumner points out (Phoenix 25, 1971, 268-269). Sumner suggests that the special distinction of the jury on which he served in Milo's trial in 52 (Cic. Mil. 74-75** cf. Ascon. 38-39C** Veil. 2.76.1) implies that he was a senator by 52. If so, his quaestorship was considerably earlier, not in 51 (MRR 2.241), and his command in Sicily in 50 and 49 (2.250, 262) was not as proquaestor but possibly as an ex praetor (cf. Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.311). It must have begun before 51, and, in view of the decree of 53 setting an interval of five years between city magistracy and provincial command, by 53. Hence his praetorship would date from 55 at the latest (Sumner, loc. cit.). Cf. J. Linderski, Stud. E. Volterra 2.285, on M. Nonius Sufenas, pr. 55, and governor of an eastern province in 51-50. On Furfanius' name, see Shackleton Bailey, CLA 2.311, 7.96ff.** CLF 2.403** and Studies 40, with evidence favoring the form Furfanus. See Wiseman, NM 233, no. 188.
Cos. 60. In MRR 2.539, Index, delete Leg., Lieut. and read Tr. mil. The tribune of the plebs, Q. Caecilius, in 68 (MRR 2.138) could be Q. Caecilius Niger, quaestor in 72 (MRR 2.117), but if he was Celer he might be the Q. Metellus who was tribune of the plebs one year and a legatus the next (Cic. Leg. Man. 58), as he was Pompey's legatus in 66 and possibly 67. An aedileship in 67 is very doubtful (Sumner, Orators 132-133** Syme, RP 2.557-565). Praetor 63. In MRR 2.166 the Q. Metellus named as praetor urbanus in Val. Max. 7.7.7 has been mistakenly identified with the pr. of 63, a year when L. Valerius Flaccus was pr. urbanus (Cic. Flacc. 6, and 100). See below, on Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus (87). Cos. 69, Pr. urbanus, probably in 73. Proconsul 62. Celer was already in his province, Gallia Cisalpina, by December 63, and cut off Catiline's retreat to the north over the Apennines (Sall. Cat. 57.2-4** Sumner, CPh 58, 1963, 215-219). On his filiation, see Sumner, Orators 132** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 107** cf. Wiseman, CQ 21, 1971, 180ff.[37]
Cos. 141. The notices in MRR (1.473, 476) regarding his promagistracy in Hisp. Ult. In 143 and 142 should be deleted. They are based on a confused passage placed by Viereck-Roos at the end of App. Ib. 68, and left by White in LCL at the end of 65. As Astin has shown (Historia 13, 1964, 245-264) the phrase # refers to the command of Fabius Maximus in Hisp. Ult. From 145 until early in 143 (MRR 1.469, 471). The rest from # should be removed. See also Simon, Kriege 82-86. Q. Pompeius (12) became governor of Hisp. Cit. when consul in 141 (MRR 1.477, 480, 482). See also Sumner, Orators 48** R. C. Knapp, Aspects 31, 196, 201-203. Consul 141. In AM 1.477, refer also to Vell. 2.21.5. Sex. Pom(peius) (17). Praetor 120? Monetalis. In MRR 2.449, delete the cognomen Fostlus, which refers to the figure of Faustulus on the coins, and insert RE no. 17. In MRR 2.449, and Index, 603, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.267-268, no. 235, 137 B.C. He may have been pr. in 120 and procos. in Macedonia in 119 (MRR 1.526, 527, note 3** Sumner, Orators 51** cf. F. Papazoglou, ANRW 2.7.1, 1979, 310).
Pr. 63. Leg., lieut. 68, 67, in Crete and Achaea under Metellus Creticus. In MRR 2.140 and 147, refer also to Schol. Bob. 97St. Propraetor in Asia. L. Robert's discovery (La Carie  2.380) near the Sacred Way at Claros of an inscribed base for an equestrian statue in honor of a Valerius Flaccus may possibly be referred to the governor in the 90s (no. 178) but more probably to his son the propraetor of 62 (no. 179): the reference to ancestral benefits (#) signals an honor to the son. In MRR 2.177, refer also to Caes. BC 3.53: qui praetor Asiam obtinuerat. The XVvir s. f. of 76 (MRR 2.95) may be Valerius Flaccus (179), but if so he did not continue as tr. mil. with Servilius Isauricus throughout his campaigns. Badian (Philologus 103, 1959, 90f.) points out that his supposed military tribunate under C. Flaccus (168) in Gaul depends on an unnecessary emendation, militem to tribunum militum, in Cic. Flacc. 63, but he did serve in his uncle's army (Schol. Bob. 96St). In MRR 2.167, add that he was praetor urbanus in 63 (Cic. Flacc. 100: urbana iurisdictio).
Cos. 39. His command in Africa Vetus in 45 (MRR 2.308) is not, as Sumner has shown, proof that he had been praetor in 46 (listed with a query, MRR 2.295). Analysis of the lists of assignments of provinces, made hastily in November 44, as given in Cicero (Phil. 3.25-27), indicates that he was a praetor in 44, and Africa was assigned to him for 43 (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 265-267** 26, 1972, 364-365). Syme (RR 221, and CPh 50, 1955, 134, after inspecting the stone) refers ILS 925 to the Cos. of 39, not to his son, Cos. 4 (PIR_ 2.93, no. 353). Another priesthood, curio maximus, should be noted in MRR 2.427f., and the Index, 2.542, and his name should be added as both septemvir epulo and curio maximus to the lists in 31. The date when he attained them remains uncertain, for T. Statilius Taurus was also curio maximus (MRR 2.424), probably after him, and survived until after 20. See Syme in Historia 13, 1964, 113?RP 2.591** and also for the suggestion that Calvisius Sabinus was the Sabinus ille of Catalepton 10, Latomus 17, 1958, 78-80-RP 1.391- 399.[48x]
Pr. before 118. Leg., envoy, 146. See MRR 1.468. The envoy sent by Metellus from Macedonia to the Assembly of the Achaeans in 146 was more probably C. Fannius C. f., since as son of the cos. of 161 he was probably older than his cousin C. Fannius M. f (also RE no. 7), who was at Carthage in that year, along with Ti. Gracchus, and may have been a comes or a junior officer on Scipio's staff. See Sumner, Orators 53-55. Tribune of the Plebs, 142. See MRR 1.475, 476, note 3. Sumner is inclined to attribute this tribunate to C. f. in spite of Cicero's impression that M. f. had been tribune in 142 (Att. 16.13b.2), not only because of Cicero's confusion of the two Fannii ? he thought that C. f. became consul later but one inscription (ILLRP 269) shows that the consul was M. f. and another that C. f. was still a praetorius in 113 (see MRR 1.536f., and 537 note 5) - but because a tribunate in 142 for M. f. makes the interval before his consulship in 122 unusually long (Orators 53-55, 171-175). On the embassy of C. Fannius C. f. to Crete, see MRR 1.536, 537, note 5.
Xvir a. d. a. See above, on L. Appuleius Saturninus (29), and C. lulius Caesar (130). The commission probably dates from 103, rather than 100, as in MRR 1.577. He was twice a tr. mil. (Inscr. Ital. 13.3, no. 6-CIL 1_.198, no. 27), about 100 B.C. See Suolahti, Junior Officers 312, 405. On his curule aedileship, see MRR 2.26, 30, note 6. He became a candidate for the consulship, most probably of 88, contrary to the leges annales omitting the praetorship, but perhaps had been granted an exemption from them (Cic. Phil. 11.11** cf. Brut. 226, Har. Resp. 43** Ascon. 25C), and was stopped by the violent opposition of Sulpicius and Antistius. See Badian, Historia 18, 1969, 481-490** T. J. Luce, Historia 19, 1970, 190-192** Lintott, CQ 26, 1971, 197-204** Sumner, Orators, 105-106** T. N. Mitchell, CPh 70, 1975, 197- 204, in favor of the consulship of 87** and A. Keaveney, Latomus 38, 1979, 451-460, arguing for 88, and holding that Strabo's purpose was to restore the victims of the Lex Varia, not to secure a command against Mithridates.
On his possible praetorship, see MRR 2.222. Sumner points out. that it is not fully attested[89x] (Orators 145). Promagistrate in Asia, 49-48 (MRR 2.262). The cistophori he issued in Asia give his filiation, C. f., and confirm that he was a pontifex (Pont) while the legend PR may stand for pr(o praetore). On his coinage, see also J. M. Cody, AJA 77, 1973, 43-50. His title is given in Joseph. (AJ 14.230) as # (MSS #) and also (14.233), quite strangely, as #. Cicero's mention of him in November 48 (Att. 11.6.6, November 27) between the names of Pompey and of Lentulus Spinther, who had died, suggests that he too had been reported dead. Perhaps the report was mistaken, a solution Cadoux prefers, since the legatus of 43 and 42 with the same name appears  as an envoy with persons of considerable seniority (MRR 2.351), and the legatus of 42 (2.365) continues in Sextus Pompey's entourage as a person of rank (App. BC 5.139). (TJC) The third place on a legation, however, often went to a younger man, so it remains possible that this legatus was not C. Fannius (9).
Cos. 94. Monetalis. In MRR 2.436, and Index, 549, refer to Crawford, RRC 1.324, no. 318, 104 B.C. Crawford identifies the monetalis with the tr. pl. of 107 and consul of 94 (MRR 1.551, and 2.12). Proconsul in Gaul, 93 to 87? Noting that the spelling Coelius has good support in the ms tradition of Liv:Per. 73, Badian has suggested that the C. Coelius who defeated the Salluvii (Caelius in MRR 2.25 and 27) may have been the consul of 94, and may have succeeded C. Licinius Crassus, Cos. 95, as governor of both the Gallic provinces. If so, he continued, like C. Sentius in Macedonia and C. Valerius Flaccus in Hisp. Cit., for several years, perhaps past 87. He was anti-Marian, for the P. Coelius (see Caelius 13** MRR 2.51) who held command in Placentia in 87 was probably a P. Coelius Caldus, and may have been connected with him, perhaps as a legatus (see P. Coelius Caldus [16] below** Badian, Studies 90-96** Mel. Piganiol 907-908). See Wiseman, NM 225, no. 127** Sumner, Orators 53, 100. Cos. 94. See Cic. Verr. 2.5.181** Mur. 17.[59x]
Tr. pl. 123, 122. Sumner (Orators 20) notes that there is no evidence that C. Gracchus was a military tribune when he served at Numantia in 134-132, probably at the age of 20 to 22 years. IIIvir a. i. a. 133-121. A boundary stone found at Polla with the names of the commissioners must be  dated between the death of Ti. Gracchus in 133 and that of Ap. Claudius in 130 (V. Bracco, NS 1953, fasc. 7-12, 337f.** cf. ILLRP 472 and notes). A similar stone, found at Sicignano in the Ager Volceius, and published by Marzullo and Guariglia, is known to me only from notices in Magaldi, Lucania romana 216ff.** see now ILLRP 469. Note another in AEpig. 1973 (1976) no. 222, from Misc. Gr. a Rom. 5, 1977, 225-249** the presence of the two names M. Fulvius and C. Gracchus without a third member dates it to the period after the death of Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus (72) and before the appointment of C. Papirius Carbo (33) in 130. See MRR 1.503. Tr. pl. 123, 122. On the law preserved on the Tabula Bembina, see above, on M'. Acilius Glabrio (37).
Tr. pl. 61. The author in 61 of the bribery law which failed of passage (MRR 2.179), known only from Cicero by the rare cognomen Lurco, may readily be identified with the M. Lurco who had gone to Asia on a legatio libera, and was therefore a senator, and who testified against L. Valerius Flaccus at his trial (Cic. Flacc. 89). He very probably was the M. Aufidius Lurco ,whom Suetonius declares to be on public record as holder of magistracies in Rome (Cal. 23.2). He may also be the well-known contemporary gourmet  (for details, see J. Linderski, below). His name should be removed from the entry about the aedile of 52 (MRR 2.235) since it is based on Willems' emendation of Plut. Cat. Min. 46.4. It is necessary to distinguish clearly between this and other Aufidii and M. Alfidius, the maternal grandfather of Livia, a municipal magistrate of Fundi, who is not known to have held magistracies in Rome, and whom Suetonius confused with Lurco (Cal. 23.2** cf. Tib. 5). See J. Linderski, Historia 23, 1974, 463-480** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.323.
Cos. 140. Praetor 145. It is uncertain whether Laelius made his agrarian proposal (MRR 1.479) in his tribunate, if he held one, or in his praetorship (1.469), or in his consulship. Scullard very reasonably favors his praetorship, before his departure for Spain, because in that year after the wars in Africa, Macedonia, and Achaea the problems of demobilization and settlement would be most intense (JRS 50, 1960, 63-66). On his Spanish command, see MRR 1.469, 471. The weight of evidence is in favor of placing the main part of his command in Hisp. Cit. in 144, after the defeat of Nigidius (1.469** Cic. Of. 2.40** Brut. 84** see Knapp, Aspects 196** cf. Simon, Roms Kriege 192-193, who would reverse the order). As a senior consular, he appears in place no. 2 in 129 in the SC de agro Pergameno (L. R. Taylor, VDRR 223** Sherk, RDGE 63-73, no. 12). For a date ca. 101, see H. B. Mattingly, AJPh 93, 1972, 412-423, and F. de Martino, PP, fasc. 210, 1983, 161-190** cf. above, on M'. Aquillius (10), a date which would exclude the consul of 140.
Cos. 146 and Procos. 145, in Achaea. An inscription at Fabrataria Nova (L. MVMI. L. F. Cos) (E. Bizzari, Epigraphica 35, 1973, 140-143), a dedication at Epidaurus (W. Peek, Neue Inschr. Aus Epidaurus, no. 47** J. M. Reynolds, JRS 66, 1976, 178), and a fragment from Nemea with Mummius as #, and the ten legates (D. W. Bradeen, Hesperia 35, 1966, no. 7, 362-379** Bull. Epig. 1968, 257) join the record of his actions and his gifts to many cities as Cos., Procos., and Censor. In an inscription of Thebes (IG 7.2413-2414) which contains two letters by a proconsul or consul, presumably in command of Macedonia, to the Technitae of Dionysus of the Isthmia and the Nemea, Klaffenbach supplied the name of L. Mummius (*Symbolae Hist. Coll. Artif. Bacch. 24-28), while Accame (Dominio Romano in Grecia 2-15) argues for M. Livius Drusus (17). Cos. 112, and Procos. Macedonia 111. For a discussion of names and dates, see Sherk, RDGE 249-252, no. 44, inclined to Mummius, also 86-93, no. 15, the SC de Coll. Artif. Bacch. Of 112 B.C.
Cos. 79. Monetalis. In MRR 2.2, 99 B.C., and 3, note 8, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.312-313, no. 299, 111 or 110 B.C. If Claudius is the praetor of 89 and consul of 79 this is a very early date even for the office of monetalis, and more so for a quaestor urbanus. The letters QVR, after the letters AP, CL, and T. Mal on the reverses of the coins, were interpreted by Mommsen (RMW 361, note 301) and others to mean quaestores urbani, consistent with date in 99, but Crawford completes QVR as the rare name Ur(binius) and suggests the earlier date. Note however C. Urbinus, quaestor under Metellus in 74 (Sall. Hist. 2.70M from Macrob. Sat. 3.13.7). Sumner rejects the name Q. Urbinius but accepts the date of 112 for the quaestor (Orators 62-63). Curule aedile. See MRR 2.21, 91 B.C. He was defeated for the office (Cic. Planc. 51), but must have held it later, as he did give the Megalesian games (Hat. Resp. 26). Praetor 89 or 88. See below, on P. Gabinius (13), for the possibility that he was really praetor in 88.[56]
Cos. 64. Quaestor 77 in Asia. In MRR 2.89, refer also to L. Robert, Monnaies antiques en Troade 16-17** C. Nicolet et al., Insula Sacra 118-119. Censor 61. A new study of the Lex Gabinia-Calpurnia de Delo of 58 (CIL 1_.2500), by which the island was freed from tribute, yields at line 21 the following text: . . . IN LOICATIONE Q[UIAM L(UCIUS) CAESAR C(AIUS) CURIO CENS(ORES) I]NSULAE DELEI FECERU[NT ... (C. Nicolet et al., Insula Sacra 149 for the text, and esp. 84-96, and 111-125 for the discussion). The locatio in question would most naturally be the one made by the most recent censors, i.e., those of 61, who have remained unknown (see MRR 2.179). The editors have shown that the L. CAE(sar) in this inscription should be the consul of 64, and make it also probable that a long-known inscription of Ilium honoring a L. Iulius Caesar, a censor (OGIS 440?ILS 8770** cf. P. Frisch, Die Inschriften von Ilion 172), which has been referred to his father (142). Cos. 90 (see MRR 2.32-33), should in fact be referred to him.
Cos. 172, 158. Leg., envoy 170-169. See MRR 1.426** and above, on Cn. Octavius (17). S. I. Oost, because of the difficulty of reconciling Polybian and annalistic traditions regarding this embassy and other events in 170 to 168, suggested that the Roman official year 170 ended in the autumn, and thus cast doubt on the Roman date, the night of September ?, for the eclipse of the moon before the battle of Pydna (June 21, Julian) (CPh 48, 1953, 219-220). Yet this eclipse was visible in Rome (Ginzel, Kanon 192) and such events were especially likely to be recorded in the pontifical annals (see Cato, fr. 77P). The Roman date has been convincingly defended by P. Meloni (Latomus 13, 1954, 553-568** Perseo 376-378** and see Walbank, Comm. Poly& 28.3-5, 3.329-331, and 29.16, 3.386, with literature cited there). See also P. Charneux, BCH 81, 1957, 181-202. On the Roman Calendar in this period, see now P. S. Derow, Phoenix 27, 1973, 345-356, with a note on this problem, 346, note 4** V. Warrior, AJAH 6, 1981, 1-50, esp. 26-39.
See MRR 2.601, and the years cited there for his career. His coinage as  monetalis (with no mention of being quaestor or aedile) is dated to 69 by Crawford (RRC 1.414-418, no. 405). His quaestorship must precede that date, as there is no room for it before his later offices (not attested in Cic. Font. 1 and 3). Crawford (RRC 1.436-437, no. 409) dates his coinage as curule aedile to 67 (see Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 132). See also Wiseman, NM 251, no. 320** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 3.320, on Att. 5.20.8. There appears to be no foundation for H. B. Mattingly?s attribution of some of the coinage to his quaestorship, in which he has him give the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae at Praeneste (NC 16, 1950, 197f.), while Alfåldi?s dating of his coinage to 62 on stylistic grounds runs counter to attested facts of his career. It is uncertain if the M. Plaetorius of Cic. Fam. 1.8.1 was a Cestianus, and there is no evidence that he held an official position under Lentulus in Cilicia in 56- 54 (see MRR 2.219, and Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.306).
Cos. 119. See MRR 1.525, 527, 529. Analysis of the confused notices in Appian Illyr. 10 and 11, and Eutropius 4.20, with consideration of the special geographical difficulties of campaigning in Dalmatia and Illyricum, leads M. G. Morgan to propose as probable solutions: (1) that Metellus Delmaticus campaigned only against the Delmatae, making Salona his base, and only in 119 and 118, and might have celebrated his triumph in 118 instead of 117, then proceeding to restore the temple of Castor and Pollux de manubiis** and (2) that the expedition of the consul of 119, L. Aurelius Cotta, and a Metellus against the Segestani involved only the one consul and a different Metellus, the praetorius Diadematus, as his legatus (Athenaeum 49, 1971, 271-301, esp. 289-294). In MRR 1.525, refer the Delmatae to Metellus and the Segestani to Cotta** in 1.526, insert Metellus Diadematus as legatus or pro praetore, with references to App. Illyr. 10** and in 1.527 and 529 give 118 or 117 as possible dates for the triumph of Delmaticus.
Cos. 25. Leg., lieut. 43. If the officer under Lepidus in 43 (MRR 2.353) may be identified with the consul of 25, he might better be listed as a tribune of the soldiers, although the case of Atticus (Nep. Att. 6.4) shows that non-senators could be legates. But the fact that the consul of 25 appears as a quaestor so late as 34 suggests that the legate of 43 may be an older man and identifiable with Caesar's legate in Gaul in 53 (2.231** no. 171). However, the rare title of quaestor pro praetore in 34 (2.412) suggests that he was then beyond normal rank and age. Note, incidentally, that Crawford (RRC 1.538-539, no. 542) dates his coinage as Q. PRO PR to 33. There was also the M. Silanus vir clarissimus who had served under Sextus Pompey and was restored by the peace of Misenum in 39 (Vell. 2.77.3** RE no. 172) who might be the legate of 53, or, if Velleius' phrase is prospective, the consul of 25. (TJC) As Mènzer remarks, it is difficult to determine to which of the various M. Silani the various notices refer.

H. Oliver, AJPh 90, 1969, 178-182, and cf. bibliography there). On the names adopted by the future Augustus, see Syme, Historia 7, 1958, 172-188-RP 1.361-377** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 117118. On the legal status of Octavian and his soldiers from the time he began to recruit them in the summer of 44 until he received an official command pro praetore and took the fasces on January 7, 43, see J. Linderski, JRS 74, 1984, 76-80.[108x]
Cos. 98. Monetalis. In MRR 2.438, and Index, 559, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.308, no. 294, 113 or 112 B.C. Praetor and proconsul in Macedonia, 101-100 or 99. See MRR 1.571, 573, note 1, 577** 2.3 and 4, note 11. See now the Cnidian copy of the Lex de Piratis, M. Hassall, M. H. Crawford, and J. M. Reynolds, JRS 64, 1974, 195-220, esp. 204, 208, 213 (SEG 26, no. 1227** 27, no. 720** 28, no. 844)** E. Badian and Th. R. Martin, ZPE 35, 1979, 15316,7** cf. also Sumner, GRBS 19, 1978, 211-225** J. H. Oliver, ZPE 32, 1978, 279. On the evidence of the coinage of P. Fonteius Capito, dated ca. 55 (see below), in which one issue has a building and the legend T. DIDI IMP VIL PUB on the reverse, and another has a mounted soldier attacking an enemy who wears a Gallic helmet and bears a Gallic shield, M. G. Morgan suggests that T. Didius rebuilt the Villa Publica with booty from his victory in Macedonia and his triumph over the Scordisci,  not from his later command in Spain (97-93 B.C.) (Klio 55, 1973, 215-231). '
Procos. in Cilicia, 47-46. See MRR 2.273 and 289** and Syme, Anat. Stud. Buckler 299-332, esp. 306-308, . 317-318-RP 1.120-148, esp. 126-128, 135-136. Syme identifies him as a brother or nephew of the consul of 56, thus rejecting Cichorius? identification with the youthful member of the consilium  of Pompeius Strabo at Asculum (RS 168-169), and would explain Cicero?s phrase pro vetere nostra consuetudine (Fam. 13.73) as a reference to an inherited relationship. As it was not necessary under Caesar to hold a praetorship before receiving a proconsular command, Sumner would reject the praetorship listed in MRR (above) (Phoenix 25, 1971, 252-254), and along with Badian (ibid. 142-144) rejects the earlier Marcius because of the long interval. Instead, he opts for a younger brother of L. Marcius Philippus (RE no. 77, cf. 74), the future consul of 38, while Badian also suggests that he may be a son of the member of the consilium. See also Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 146-148** and Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.437-439.
Cos. 158. In MRR 1.421, 170 B.C., Leg., amb. a, cancel the reference to M. Aemilius Lepidus (68). Cos. 187, and substitute the consul of 158, above. Laelius as senior man marks the dignity of the embassy. Willems has shown that the regular pattern for two-man embassies is one senior and one junior (Senat .2.496). On the Decemvirate of the consul of 158 (above), see below, the note on M. Aemilius Lepidus Porcina (83). If we accept Schåne's emendation pro collegio in Frontin. Aq. 1.7, the consul of 158 becomes the most probable identification for the M. Lepidus who spoke on behalf of the college in 143 (Sumner, Orators 47-48). Sumner's suggestion that the successor of M'. Aemilius Lepidus Numida (103) as Decemvir in 211 was another M'. Aemilius Lepidus (see above, on M. Aemilius Lepidus [67], Pr. 218), his son, and father of the consul of 158, brings three generations of Lepidi in order into the Decemvirate, but adduces a Lepidus who existed but has otherwise no known career.
Tr. Pl. 89 Or 88. See MRR 2.34. Rather than ?superseding other legislation regarding new citizens,? such as the Lex Iulia of 90 (MRR 2.25), the Lex Plautia Papiria settled the status of those enrolled (adscripti) in allied states who made a declaration before a praetor within sixty days (see Cic. Arch. 7), and thus supplemented the general law (Sherwin-White, Roman Citizenship 132ff.). Note that this meant any praetor, not just the praetor urbanus (Badian, Studies 75-77). Badian has shown that the date of the law, that is, whether it was passed early or late in 89, determines whether these tribunes, and the praetors concerned with its administration, Q. Metellus Pius (98), Ap. Claudius Pulcher (296), and P. Gabinius (13) (MRR 2.33), should be dated to 89 or 88 (Badian, Studies 75- 77). See L. R. Taylor, VDRR 243, and MAAR 24, 1956, 9-30** and now A, Keaveney and J. Madden, Eranos 81, 1983, 47-51, strongly in favor of dating these praetorships to 89** cf. CS 19, 1982, 499-544, esp. 502-507.
IIvir aedi locandae in 217 (MRR 2.245) and Q. Claudius Flamen (151, cf. 29). Praetor at Tarentum, 208 (MRR 1.290) . The praenomen Q. is rare in the Gens Claudia, and the cognomen, which is given in the dative (Flamini) appears in one group of manuscripts as Flaminio. The cognomen Claudus of the consul of 271 raises the suggestion that Claudius Flamen's name may possibly have been Quinctius Claudus Flamininus, perhaps also the IIvir of 217. But Livy repeatedly refers to him during his years at Tarentum as Q. Claudius (MRR 1.290, 295, 299). Badian's suggestion, given above, also suggests that he was an uncle of Flamininus, the future consul of 198, who appears in 205, 204, and perhaps until 202, as propraetor in Tarentum in succession to him (Liv. 29.13.6 in 204, with the phrase ut priore anno** see MRR 1.303, 308). See Badian, JRS 61, 1971, 106-110. But see also E. Rawson's convincing arguments for keeping the name of Q. Claudius Flamen (Historia 26, 1977, 340-357, esp. 349-351).
Tr. pl. -. See MRR 1.541 and 542, note 2. Earlier views regarding the much discussed Lex Thoria are summarized in F. Niccolini, FTP 178-184. In MRR 1.542, note 2, I accepted the interpretation presented by E. F. D'Arms in AJPh 56, 1935, 232-245. See now the various views presented by Gabba, Appiano 69-73, and ed. of Appian BC 1 (1958) pp. 93-96, comm. on 1.27** Badian, Studies (1963) 235-241** Douglas, Brutus (1966) 249** and cf., briefly, Sumner, Orators (1973) 90-91. Badian accepts Thorius as the proper correction for Appian's #, and interprets Cicero's Brutus 136 as meaning He relieved the public land of a faulty and useless law by means of a rent. The Lex Thoria may well be the second of Appian's three, the third being the Lex agraria of 111. Note also J. S. M. Willcock (CQ 32, 1982, 474-475) who would emend levavit in Cic. Brut. 136 to locavit, and translate the passage Sp. Thorius ... who let out the public land for a rent by means of a faulty and useless law. The puzzle remains unsolved.
Tr. pl.? 90? See MRR 2.33-34. Since Sisenna refers to him in Book III of his Histories (fr. 17P, cf. 119, 120P), his tribunate should be dated to 90, not to 89 as in MRR, and his law very probably precedes the Lex lulia in the autumn (see E. Gabba, Republican Rome: The Army and the Allies 90-91** P. Frassinetti, Athenaeum 50, 1972, 78-113, esp. 96). Syme (RS, MS-RP 1.277) questions his identification as a Piso Frugi and suggests that he was a Caesoninus (Cic. Pis. 87, for the cognomen), a son of the cos. of 112, and possibly not tribune but praetor in 90. If so, he might also be identified with L. Piso, a # in Asia in this period (MRR 2.463** I. Priene 121, cf. p. 551), whose activity Syme would date toward 83, not before 90, as in MRR** but see now Sumner, Governors of Asia in the Nineties B.C., GRBS 19, 1978, 147-153, who would date his governorship ca. 100 or ca. 97. If the tr. pl. of 90 was a Caesoninus he must in any case be distinguished from Frugi (98), the pr. of 74. See p. 28.
Cos. 99. Leg., lieut. 110. In MRR 1.544, refer also to Schol. Bern. on Lucan 4.319320, p. 131U** Sall. Iug. 55.1** Ammian. 25.9.11** Veget. RM 3.10, p. 93, 8 Lang. Mènzer (RE no. 32, cf. 33, 34) holds that this disgrace ended the legate's career, and so he should not be identified with the consul of 99 (33) or with Sulla's legate in 89 (34). Note however that there is no record that this Postumius was among the persons condemned by the Mamilian Commission, and that in 100 the unusual circumstances of the elections for 99 might have enabled him to press his claim to advancement (see also Sumner, Orators 83-84). Because of the age group with which he is listed in Cic. Brut. 135, Sumner suggests that he had been praetor by 111 and was a praetorius when he was legate of his brother in 110, this in preference to 102, the latest possible date (MRR 1.568), and thus had a better chance when he came late and unexpectedly to the consular elections for 99.
A certain P. Vatienus is named in a Roman sepulchral inscription (Bull. Com. 56, 1928, 293** cf. CIL 6.39023, a freedman). Both inscriptions are cited by Syme, Historia 5, 1956, 208RP 1.320. He may be a grandson of P. Vatienus of Reate to whom the Dioscuri revealed the victory at Pydna (Cic. ND 2.6** 3.11 and 13, with the reading Vatinius** cf. Val. Max. 1.8.4, where most manuscripts read Vatinius with the variant Vacienus** Lactant. 2.7.10, vatieno), but the possibility that he was a senator depends on CIL 1_.821-ILLRP 384: [Corn]elia L. Scipion[is f.] Vatieni. As the youthful interlocutor in the De Natura Deorum (dramatic date 76) was also a son-in-law of the consul of 83, he had good prospects of a senatorial career. In any case, Vatinius seems excluded both as the inferior reading in the passages of Cicero and as a man whose grandfather was not a citizen (note Act. Tr. for 42, where the grandfather's praenomen is lacking). (LRT) See Wiseman, NM 270, no. 466.[216x]
Cos. 143. Salius? by 167? Augur before 133. See MRR 1.436, 473, 495. Since he could not remain a Salius after attaining a major priesthood, Claudius, even if he was once aMRR3Salius before becoming an augur (Plut. TG 4.1), cannot be the Ap. Claudius vir triumphalis in Macrob. Sat. 3.14.14, who gained fame by dancing as a Salius in his old age. Cos. 143, Pr. by 146. G. R. Verbrugghe attributes the acephalous elogium of Polla, not to Popillius Laenas, but to the consul of 143, the building of the road to his consulship, the return of Italian runaway slaves to a praetorship in Sicily (not otherwise attested), and the assignment of public land, previously pasture, to aratores to his service on the Gracchan land commission (CPh 68, 1973, 25-35** cf. MRR 1.495, 499, 501). In his consulship however he was occupied with a campaign in northern Italy (1.471). On his possible place in the inscription of Polla, see now A. E. Gordon, Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy no. 44, pp. 87-89. Triumvir a. i. a. 133-130. See below, on C. Sempronius Gracchus (47).
On his praetorships (MRR 2.57 and 60), refer also to the statues erected vicatim in his honor but thrown down at the coming of Sulla (Plin. NH 33.132** 34.27). Sumner would date his first praetorship to 85, as in MRR, but would accept praetor in Val. Max. 9.2.1 over praetorius in Firm. Mat. 1.3, and date his second, as well as his death, in 82 (Orators 118-119). His tribunate, dated to 87 in MRR 2.47, and Niccolini, Fasti 232-234, could possibly have run from December 10, 87, to December 9, 86. The date depends on the date on which the Marians planned to put Catulus on trial. This trial was intended to take the form of a iudicium populi with Gratidianus as the prosecuting tribune (Schol. Bern. On Lucan 2.173 [Usener]** Diod. 3839.4.2** App. BC 1.74 [cf. Gabba?s comment at 1.341-342]** R. Brecht, Perduellio 301** H. Bennett, Cinna and His Times 27). A tribunate and a praetorship in successive years (86, 85) would be quite irregular, but it was a stormy period.[140x]
Cos. 80. Monetalis, the issue of coins inscribed Q.C.M.P.I. In MRR 2.434, and Index, 539-540, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.390, no. 374, 81 B.C. Praetor 89 or 88. See below, on P. Gabinius (13), leg., envoy to Marius and Cinna, 87. Refer also to Diod. 38-39.2. B. R. Katz holds that 89 is the more probable date of his praetorship (The Siege of Rome in 84 B.C., CPh 71, 1976, 328-336, esp. 330, note 9). Proconsul. He continued in Africa until expelled by the governor C. Fabius Hadrianus in 84? (MRR 2.60, reading # for # in App. BC 1.80** E. Linden, De bello civili Sullano 57, Freiburg in Br. 1896). A. Keaveney (Klio 66, 1984, 130) keeps the ms reading in Appian and holds that when driven out of Africa he went to  Liguria before joining Sulla (cf. E. Gabba, Comm. Appian BC 1.80, 365, who quotes Linden, above, and suggests that Metellus may have gone to Liguria first). Cos. 80, Procos. in Hisp. Ult., 79-71. See below, on Q. Sertorius (3).
Who issued coins along with Ap. Cl. And Q. Ur. In MRR 2.2 and 3, note 8, the letters Q. Ur. Are taken as marking the coinage of quaestores urbani (following Mommsen, RMW 561, and Grueber, CRRBM 1.199), and the issues are dated to 99. Crawford (RRC 1.312-313, no. 299) takes them as a group of three moneyers: Ap. Cl(audius) (296). Cos. 79** possibly T. Mal(oleius) (this is in preference to Mal(lius), but favors reading the monogram as Manl(ius), who would then be RE no. 61)** and Q. Ur(binius). He dates them to 111 or 110. This makes a long interval for Claudius until his praetorship in 89 (MRR 2.33), but is quite consistent with identifying Manlius with T. Manlius Mancinus (61). Tr. Pl. 107 (MRR 1.551). The name Ur(binius) should probably be read as Urbinus, like that of the quaestor of 74 (Sall. Hist. 2.70** Macrob. Sat. 3.13.7** MRR 2.103). See also Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 138** Wiseman, NM 281, no. 541. In MRR 2.4, line 2, delete the words ?143 and.?
Tr. pl. 50. Quaestor and proquaestor in Asia, 55? to early 52? He is named without title in an inscription of Caunus of Caria (G. E. Bean, JHS 74, 1954, 89, nos. 23, 24) along with a C. Scribonius C. f. Curio who is probably his son, and Memmia C. f., either his son's wife or his own. See Sumner, Orators 148, and stemma of the Memmii, 87. Promagistrate or Legatus pro praetore 49. See MRR 2.263264. In 49 Curio was most probably a legatus pro praetore by Caesar's appointment as his lictors were laureati, but he presented himself ambiguously as propraetore with six lictors instead of five ex senatus consulto surrupto (Cic. Att. 10.4.9-10). He is termed legatus in Livy (Per. 110) and Suet. Iul. 36, but is recorded by Appian (BC 2.7) as accepting acclamation as imperator from his army in Africa. Note in Caesar's account his choice of death for losing the army quem a Caesare fidei commissum acceperit (BC 2.42.4). See Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.404.
Praetor, uncertain date. The former was senior legate of Marius in 102 (MRR 1.569, 570, note 6), whom Sumner considers to be already a praetorius (Orators 91-93). He was also a senior legate under L. Iulius Caesar in 90 and was the defender of Aesernia under siege (E. Gabba, Comm. on App. BC 1.4042** cf. MRR 2.28). He had already come under attack from L. Licinius Crassus, Cos. 95, in the later 90s and was acquitted (Cic. Font. 24** Val. Max. 8.5.3** cf. Gruen, RPCC 194, 204). Sumner distinguishes him from the curule aedile of 91 (Orators 93** cf. MRR 2.21, note 7), and with Mènzer on RE no. 227 identifies the latter with the M. Claudius M. f. Arn. Marcellus, the senior praetorius listed in the consilium of 73 (SIG? 747** Sherk, RDGE 133-138, no. 23), who must have held the praetorship many years before. It is not certain how offices should be divided between nos. 226 and 227 (Sumner, loc. cit.** Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 132).
Usually considered the elder son of the consul of 70. Praefectus equitum, 58, perhaps 57-56. In MRR 2.199, refer also to J. Suolahti, Junior Officers 216, 292. In MRR 2.204, refer to Caes. BG 3.21.2. Quaestor 55? Sydenham (CRR 155) dates his SC coinage to 54, but H. B. Mattingly attributes it to a quaestorship which he dates in 55, holding that the type refers to his father's part in Sulla's victory and that he gave the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae at Praeneste as quaestor urbanus (NC 16, 1956, 20f.). While this seems doubtful, note that Crawford dates the coinage and the quaestorship to 55 (RRC 1.454, no. 430). See Sumner, Orators 149-150. Syme, however, has shown that the balance of evidence favors considering that Marcus was the elder son, and raises further doubt that Publius was a quaestor when he issued his coinage or that he was a quaestorius when he joined his father in Syria (Latomus 39, 1980, 403-408-RP 3.1220-1225).
Pr. 88, Pro pr. Asia. See MRR 2.40, 50, 56, 61, 62 note 4. A. Keaveney holds that he was more probably praetor in 88 than in 87 since he held command under Sulla immediately afterwards in Greece against the forces of Mithridates. He interprets Cic. Mur. 15, ex praetura triumphasset, on the basis of the meaning of ex in corresponding phrases in Vell. 2.33.1, 59.1, 78.3, to mean that he had held an imperium pro praetore continuously from his praetorship through his service with Sulla and his command in Asia, and acclamation as imperator, until his triumph in 81 (AC 51, 1982, 123-124). The acclamation and the triumph support his view, but on the meaning of ex see also the phrase consulatum ex quaestura (Liv. 32.7.9) on Flamininus in 198. He was honored at Caunus with his son, C. Licinius Murena (119), as imperator (B. Bernhardt, Anadolu 16, 1972, 137** J. M. Reynolds, JRS 66, 1976, 117** Tuchelt, Frèhe Denkm•ler 1.153-154).
Q(uaestor), named on quadrantes of Corduba. In MRR 2.287, he is dated, at Grant's suggestion, to 47 or 46. In Moneda hispanica en la Edad Antigua (Madrid, 1966), 300-301, no. 1263, Gil Farres agrees that the head of Venus on the obverse and the Cupid with torch and cornucopia refer to the Iulian gens, but puts the date, though still uncertain, before 49. See C. Castillo, Hispania Antigua 4, 1974, 191-202** R. C. Knapp, Aspects 187. But in Roman Cordoba 15-16, although Knapp admits that Cn. Iulius may be a Roman official, and as a L(uci) f(ilius) possibly connected with the family of the consul of 64, he thinks that a date of 120-100 for the coins is preferable, and, noting the praenomen Cn. is otherwise unknown in the Iulian gens in Italy, would consider this Cn. Iulius to be an obscure local quaestor, and perhaps an official of the Conventus civium Romanorum of Corduba. See below, on Cn. or C. Iulius Mento (360).
Cos. 153. Both Livy (39.44.10) and Cicero (Brut. 79) identify the IIIvir  col. deduc. of 184 (MRR 1.377) with the future consul of 153. Sumner finds this incredible since he and his older brother Marcus (Cos. 159) must have suffered a most improbable delay in their careers if Quintus was old enough to be a colonial commissioner by 184 (at 43 years of age in 153 he would be only 13 or 14 in 184). His suggestion is that the commissioner was not Quintus but his brother Marcus, then about 20 years of age, and that M. Fulvius M. f. (Nobilior) and Q. Fulvius M. f. (really a Flaccus) in the original records received the wrong cognomina (Orators 40, and stemma, 41). It must remain a hypothesis. On the difficulty of identifying the different Fulvii of this period, see MRR 1.391, note 3. Quintus may well have been the Q. Fulvius M. f. (29) who became IIIvir Epulo in 180 (Liv. 40.42.7, tum praetextatus). See Sumner, loc. cit.
According to Pliny (NH 35.8) the true line of the Scipios became extinct during the lifetime of Messalla (268). Cos. 53, and the family was represented only by an adoptive Scipio called Pomponianus Salvitto. This Scipio should probably be identified with the unimportant Scipio whom Caesar, deriding the claims of Metellus Scipio, treated as a commander in Africa in 46 (Plut. Caes. 52.2, a member of the house of Africanus called Sallustio** Suet. Iul. 59, Salvitoni** Dio 42.58.1). He may perhaps be identified with the officer under the Triumvirs who issued coins at Lipara in 37-36 (P. Corneli, MRR 2.478, and see above), and the suffect consul of 35 (2.406), whose name is preserved only in an abbreviated form. The praenomen may be given by the filiation of the consul of 16, P. f. P. n., probably a son of the consul of 35. (TJC) See also Shackleton Bailey, Studies 114-115.[72]
Cos. 199. Aed. cur. 209 or 205? Sumner questions the correctness of Livy's statement (29.11.12) that this Lucius was elected and served as curule aedile in absence in 205 (he was then proconsul in Spain, MRR 1.302). Sumner would identify him with L. Cornelius Lentulus Caudinus (212), curule aedile in 209 (see MRR 1.286), but keep him consul in 199, while attributing the curule aedileship of 205 to his younger brother Publius (214), who became praetor in 203 (MRR 1.311). See Orators 140, and stemma, 143, and Arethusa 3, 1970, 89. Two brothers remain as curule aediles together in 205, but not the same two as in MRR 1.302. R. C. Knapp, Aspects of the Roman Experience in Iberia, 206-100 B.C 91, note 18, accepts Livy's text. Note that C. Cornelius Cethegus (88), procos. in Spain 201-200 (Liv. 30.41.4-5) received a successor when elected aed. cur. for 199 in absence (31.50.11).
Named as a proconsul or praetor pro consule in a decree of Rhodes found at Thasos (Chr. Dunant and J. Pouilloux, Etudes Thas. V, 2.26-35, no. 172). This governor of Macedonia is not named elsewhere nor is it certain whether his cognomen was Cotta or Orestes. The authors, noting that the lettering is in favor of a date in the late second or the early first century, review the known Aurelii but in the absence of a cognomen come to no certain conclusion. See also F. Papazoglou, ANRW 2.7.1, 1980, 310** Badian, Gnomon  33, 1961, 493. Note, however, that L. Aurelius Cotta (102), Pr. 70, was available for a province in 69, and that there is a vacancy between 71 and 68 in the list of Macedonian governors, a vacancy for which H. B. Mattingly suggests the name of L. Iulius Caesar (143). Cos. 64, Pr. by or before 67 (Chiron 9, 1979, 147-168), in connection with the problem of dating the Aesillas coins.
Pr. ? 44. Delete the query, since he shared in the allotments made in the Senate meeting of November 28 (MRR 2.321). Two Cusinii are named in ILS 965, a father who was not a senator, and M. Cusinius M. f. Vel., Aed. pl., Aerario praef., Pr. The latter should be identified with the praetor of 44, and both the quaestorship, if he held it, and the aedileship will have preceded it. The post of aerario praefectus must precede 28 (Dio 53.2.1), but if the offices are in chronological order the post is anomalous and suggests that he may have been one of the prefects of the city (#, Dio 43.48), two of whom were in charge of finances (#), whom Caesar left in charge in 45 (MRR 2.313), or else, as Badian suggests, he was placed in charge of the treasury as ledile of the plebs (Gnomon 33, 1961, 496). See the notes on L. Cestius (4) and C. Norbanus (9a). (RS, CP** TJC** LRT** and now see Wiseman, NM 228, no. 150).
Honored as legatus pro praetore and tribunus plebis designatus in an inscription of Demetrias of Thessaly on a monument which was replaced by one to Julius Caesar (A. E. Raubitschek, JRS 44, 1954, 66 [I], and note 6). T. A. Arvanitopoulos, Polemon 1, 1929, 204 (also Arch. Eph. 1916, 151** Arch. Delt. 10, 1926, 51** Arch. Eph. 1929, 142)** Groag, Råm. Reichsbeamten von Achaia 102, no. 441** S. Accame, Dominio 227, no. 3** Raubitschek, loc. cit.** Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 133, all identify him with C. Caelius (Coelius?) Caldus who was tr. pl. in 51 (Cic. Fam. 8.8.6-8** RE no. 7** MRR 2.241). Shackleton Bailey, who reads C. Coelius in CLF, points out that the tr. pl. of 51 acted in Caesar's favor, while Rufus was removed in order to honor Caesar, and was probably a Pompeian, and another person. If so, his dates as legatus and as tribune are uncertain but must precede Caesar's victory in 48.
Quaestor in Cyprus (Cic. Fam. 13.48). The date is uncertain but must be after Cicero's proconsulate in Cilicia (51-50) and before Caesar returned the island to a Ptolemaic ruler in 47 (Dio 42.35.5). (TJC) His office was wrongly dated to 47 in MRR 2.287, and to 48 or 47 by A. J. Marshall (Phoenix 19, 1964, 206-215), since the fiscal organization which Caesar introduced affected, so far as we know, only Asia at that time, and for 47 there were elections only of plebeian magistrates before Caesar's return to Italy in the autumn. As Badian points out (JRS 55, 1965, 113-115), probabilities favor Sextilius' election in 50 for 49, and either his mandate was to be a special quaestor to Cyprus, or else the governor of Cilicia, who would in this case be P. Sestius, was now required to send his quaestor to the island. See also Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 263** and Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 130.
Cos. 98. Aedile? ca. 104. G. Manganaro suggests that, in view of the critical scarcity of grain in Rome caused by the outbreak of the Second Slave War in Sicily (104-101), the Q. Metellus Q. f., agoranomos, the Roman aedile in office named in a recently discovered inscription of Larisa of Thessaly, who came there in person while in office to arrange for a collection, purchase, and transport of grain from there to Rome in a time of scarcity, was not Metellus Macedonicus, as suggested above, but his grandson Metellus Nepos, Cos. 98, whose aedileship, if he held it (it is not otherwise attested), should be dated to ca. 104 or 103 (Chiron 113, 1983, 405-409). The form and script of the inscription, according to Professor Chr. Habicht, point to a considerably earlier date, and it should still be referred most probably, as above, to Metellus Macedonicus (94).
There were two brothers Hirtulei serving under Sertorius in Spain, who both died in the battle of Segovia against Metellus Pius in 75 (Flor. 2.10.7, Hirtulei** Oros. 5.23.12, Hirtulei fratres interfecti** Auct. Vir. Ill. 63, Herculei fratres). The brother of L. Hirtuleius may be identified with Q. Hirtuleius L. f. Ser., who was a member of the staff of Pompeius Strabo at Asculum in 88 (ILS 8888?CIL 6.37045** cf. Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 20, 140-141), and one or the other may be the Hirtuleius (1) who held a quaestorship in or soon after 86 (MRR 2.54). Q. Hirtuleius may well have been an officer too, but his title is not attested and the deeds of the brothers are not fully distinguishable. See Mènzer RE on nos. 3 and 4** Cichorius RS 167** Criniti, loc. cit.** E. Gabba, Athenaeum 32, 1954, 107** Maurenbrecher, pp. 44, 68, 71, in his edition of Sall. Hist. (RS, CP)[102x]
Pr. 44. Quaestor and pro quaestore. See MRR 2.229, 237, 242. To the sources listed under 53, Quaestors (MRR 2.229), add Liv. Per. 108** Plut. Crass. 18** App. BC 4.59** Festus Brev. 17** Auct. Vir. Ill. 83. Although they appear unanimously to term him quaestor in 53, his office must begin in an earlier year, perhaps even with Crassus' consulship in 55, since there was no election of magistrates during 54, nor in 53 before July, at least a month after the battle of Carrhae on June 9 (Linderski, CPh 70, 1975, 35-37): He then served pro quaestore until his return in 51, and is so addressed in Cic. Fam. 15.14. See also G. V. Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 365. Proconsul 43-42. In MRR 2.343 and 360, on his coinage, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.513-514, nos. 498-500, 43-42 B.C. XVvir s. f. On his coinage in 43-42 with symbols of this priesthood, see Crawford, RRC 1.513, nos. 498, 499.
Cos. 221. See MRR 1.240, Special Commissions, on the Triumviri agris dandis assignandis for the founding of Cremona and Placentia. On the basis of a fresh analysis of the discordant ancient texts (see MRR 1.240, and 241, note 12), G. Bandelli has concluded that there were two colonial commissions, one for Placentia, led by P. Cornelius Scipio Asina with P. Papirius Maso and Cn. Cornelius Scipio as colleagues, and the other for Cremona, led by C. Lutatius Catulus with C. Servilius Geminus and M. Annius as his colleagues. When the Gauls revolted the members of the Placentia commission escaped and took refuge in Mutina, but members of the Cremona commission were captured at Tannetum. When M'. Acilius and C. Herennius came as envoys from Mutina to negotiate for the restoration of the captives the Gauls seized them too. See G. Bandelli, QSAE 2, 1978, 39-57.[130x]
Cos. 109? Monetalis. In MRR 2.443, and Index, 577, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.300-301, no. 285, 116-115 B.C. Note Crawford's remarks on the difficulty of identifying him. Tr. pl. The author of the Lex Iunia de repetundis is named M. lunius D. f. in the Tabula Bembina. Date and context cannot be defined more closely, although identifications of the author with various Iunii, including the above, have been suggested. His tribunate should not be dated earlier than 124 (Sumner, Orators 78). See MRR 1.513** Tibiletti, Athenaeum 31, 1953, 91. In MRR 1.535, and 537, note 2, delete the references to a praetorship in Spain (Sumner, Orators 78). Consul and Proconsul. As Cassius Longinus (62). Cos. 107, did not succeed him in Transalpine Gaul until 107, the defeat of Silanus by the Cimbri should be dated in 108 (Badian, Mel. Piganiol 913, note 3** cf. MRR 1.545).
See MRR 2.122. The praenomen and the nomen of the Postumus who was a[79x][candidate in 63 for a praetorship in 62, and so was probably quaestor by or before 71, remain unattested. He was also one of the prosecutors of Murena (Cic. Mur. 54, 56, 57a, 69). Mènzer in his discussion at RE no. 24 expresses serious doubt that he could be a Curtius (cf. Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 134). Sumner (Orators 144145) considers him a Postumius Albinus, perhaps brother or nephew of Postumia, wife of Servius Sulpicius Rufus,  the unsuccessful consular candidate. Shackleton Bailey (Studies 58-59) points out that it requires emendation of the forms of the word Postumius in the Pro Murena in four cases out of five (see above), but is, even so, inclined to identify him with the monetalis C. Postumius (12), whom Crawford would date to 74. See below, on C. Postumius (12) and L.? Postumius (15).
Cos. 116. Praetor 120 or 119. The name # in the fragmentary inscription, found at Arizli near ancient Synnada in Phrygia, with the text of an SC dealing with the arrangements when the Romans reclaimed Phrygia after the death of Mithridates V of Pontus in 120, has rightly been taken to be that of C. Licinius Geta (OGIS 436-Sherk, RDGE no. 13** cf. MRR 1.530). T. Drew-Bear has shown (Historia 21, 1972, 75-87) that this name, which is preserved alone without that of his consular colleague, Q. Fabius Maximus Eburnus (111), need not be referred to his consulship in 116, but probably (like that of the praetor, C. Popillius C. f. in OGIS 435-Sherk, RDGE no. 11, in 133) should be referred to his praetorship in 120 or 119 (MRR 2.526). He could have presided over the Senate when it took action immediately after the death of Mithridates V, if the consuls were absent.
Praetor before 49? See MRR 2.620 (Index). His position in 45 when Cicero (without using the praenomen) termed him parochus publicus (Att. 13.2.2) and his relationship with Caesar at that time (Att. 13.7.1) are the very insecure basis for the suggestion that he was one of the prefects whom Caesar left in charge of Rome during the Spanish campaign of 45 (MRR 2.313** Mènzer, RE no. 6** Drumann-Grobe 3.569, note 8** E. Meyer, Caesars Monarchie 430, note 2). On the problem raised because he is listed second in the commission in the SC de Panamareis (Sherk, RDGE 158, no. 27) before L. Nonius Asprenas (Cos. Buff. 36) and after him in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus, both dated to 39, see J. M. Reynolds (Aphrodisiac and Rome 69-71), who suggests that the order of precedence created by the naming of future consuls in the peace of Misenum in the same year explains the change.
See MRR 2.265. No mention is made of his quaestorship, but it has been generally assumed in spite of references to his youth (Caes. BC 1.8** Suet. Iul. 75.3** cf. Cic. Att. 7.13a.2) that he went on his mission to Caesar in January 49 as a senator and an official envoy of the Senate, and Sumner attributes one by or before 50 to him because of it (see the stemmata, Phoenix 25, 1971, 204 and 258, and CPh 71, 1976, 343). Although Shackleton Bailey has shown that L. Caesar and L. Roscius were almost certainly not official envoys of the Senate (JRS 50, 1960, 80-83** CLA 4.441-447, App. 3), L. Caesar's later commands and the attainment of the quaestorship by his younger brother Sextus by 48 (Dio 47.26** MRR 2.289** see Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 258) strongly favor quaestorian rank. But see also Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.314, and Onom.[110x]
Cos. Suff. 36, Procos. Africa 46. As Sumner has shown (Phoenix 25, 1971, 260), his command in Africa under Caesar in 46 (MRR 2.298) is no proof that he was praetor in 47** so, too, Badian (Phoenix 25, 1971, 138-141), who uses ILS 884 (ILLRP 432) from Valentia, ... ([L. Non]io L. fil. | [asp]renati pro p[r(aetore | ), to suggest that he had command also in Gallia Transalpina, perhaps in 49, before Decimus Brutus. (RS, CP** TJC) His father was perhaps L. Nonius T. f. Vel., a member of the consilium of Pompeius Strabo in 89 (Cichorius, RS 170** Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 153-155). His position as third in the lists of senators, both in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus of 39 (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 57, 61), and the SC de Panamareis of the same year (Sherk, RDGE 170171, no. 29), show that he was then a senior ex- praetor.
Quaestor urbanus 81. Shackleton Bailey points out (Studies 71-72) that in Cic. Verr. 2.1.37 the manuscript tradition is strongly in favor of the praenomen C. (not L. as in MRR 2.77). This makes it possible to identify him with the Valerius Triarius who opposed Lepidus in Sardinia in 77 (MRR 2.91), preferably as a legatus pro praetore, if A. J. Marshall is right in holding that provincial governors after Sulla, whether praetorii or consulares, regularly held an imperium pro consule (ANRW 1.1, 1972, 903). According to Asconius (19C), he was later a leg., lieut. under Lucullus in the East from 73 to 67 (MRR 2.113, 120, 125, 130, 134, 141, 148). P. A. Brunt (Manpower 454-455) suggests that Triarius first was legate under M. Cotta in 74 in command of three legions which he brought to Lucullus. The entries in the Index may run as follows:
Cos. 100. Monetalis. In MRR 2.454, and Index, 629, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.316, no. 306, 108 or 107 B.C. Badian holds that all the cases listed in Cic. Div. in Caec. 63 must be dated close to the end of the second century, and that therefore the M. Aurelius Scaurus concerned was not the consul of 108 but a later Scaurus (see above, Aurelius no. 216) and that the Flaccus named may well be the consul of 100, praetor and provincial governor about 104 and 103 (PACA 1, 1958, 10?Studies 86-87** and Gnomon 33, 1961, 498** see also Gruen, RPCC 178-179). If so, Flaccus and Scaurus should be removed from MRR 1.529, 117 B.C. See now Badian, Klio 66, 1984, 298-301, who identifies the proconsul L. Flaccus with L. Valerius Flaccus (178), governor in Asia in the 90s. See above, on M. Aurelius Scaurus (215 and 216?).[211x]
Tr. Pl. 56, Pr. 55? One charge against Cato in 54 was probably minuta maiestas (Cic. Att. 4.15.4** J. Linderski, Studi E. Volterra 2.283-302, esp. 291f), and he was also prosecuted under the Lex Fufia and acquitted (Att. 4.16.5). Why was he not prosecuted in 55 immediately after his tribunate in 56? Perhaps because of the control exercised in that year by Pompey and Crassus, but if, as seems very probable, he was the Cato praetorius who hastened away from the trial of Gabinius de maiestate in 54 in order to inform Pompey of the acquittal (Cic. QF 3.4.1** Linderski, op. cit. 287-288) he must have been praetor in 55. This was possible since  his tribunate ended on December 10, 56, and the elections for 55 were not carried through until after an interregnum at the beginning of 55. See J. Jahn, Interregnum and Wahldiktatur 167-172.[169x]
Cos. 138. Leg., envoy 148. Upon receipt of news of the advance of Andriscus in Macedonia and Greece, Scipio Nasica was sent to make arrangements to oppose him (Dio in Zonaras 9.28.4). Praetor 141. See MRR 2.477. As he was away from Rome when he was elected pont. max. in 141 in succession to his father Scipio Corculum (Veil. 2.3.1** MRR 1.478, 479, note 2), M. G. Morgan, after showing that the Scordisci could be considered Pannonians, identifies him with the Cornelius who suffered defeat at the hands of the Pannonians (App. Illyr. 14) and the governor of Macedonia who suffered disaster Wades) at the hands of the Scordisci in 141 (Liv. Oxy. Per. 54). See Historia 23, 1974, 183-216, esp. 208-215. Leg., amb. 132. See MRR 1.499. On this embassy in Asia, see B. Schleussner, Chiron 6, 1976, 97-112.
In the Index (MRR 2.525), delete the entry Q.? Sicily, p. 478. The quaestor is the M'. Acilius (11) listed earlier. The form of the praenomen and the cognomen of Caesar's legate in 48 (MRR 2:280) and the proconsul of Sicily in 46 (MRR 2.296) is almost surely settled by the record of the name in an Ostian inscription as M. Acilius Caninus (ILLRP 435** cf. MRR 2.285, note 8), probably a son. See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 5** CLF 2.435-436** and CQ 10, 1960, 257, note 1. Sumner has shown that his praetorship in 47 (listed in MRR 2.287, on the basis of his proconsulate in 46) is very uncertain in this period under Caesar (Phoenix 25, 1971, 261). He was probably the Acilius who was in Graeciam cum legionibus missus in 45, and whom Cicero had twice defended on a capital charge (Cic. Fam. 7.30.3, and 31.1** cf. 13.50** MRR 2.308).
Cos. 34. Monetalis. In MRR 2.451, and Index, 614, refer also to[186x] Crawford, RRC 1.441-442, no. 416, 62 B.C. Crawford admits the possibility that the monetalis was the consul of 34, but prefers to attribute the office to his father (ILS 8892ILLRP 411, 567, 568). Libo (and Hypsaeus) may have been senators in 56 (Fam. 1.1.3), but there is no evidence about their tribunates (Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.296 on Fam. 1.1.3). The date of Libo's praetorship remains uncertain. He held, as Mènzer points out, important commands in the Pompeian forces in 49 and 48 (MRR 2.269 and 282), but probably as a legatus. In 39 he was listed fourth in the commission in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus (Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 68), although designation for the consulate might explain placing Asprenas, Cos. 36, ahead of him.
Pr. 89? Procos. Cilicia 88. See MRR 2.42. In J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 11- 16, Document 2 records his appeal from Laodiceia for assistance against Mithridates and the decision of Aphrodisias-Plarasa to give it with all its forces, while Document 3 (ibid. 16-20) records a letter from him in  Cos (probably in 85 and certainly after Mithridates released him at Sulla?s demand, App. Mith. 112) in which he responds to an embassy from the city and accepts the position of patron. Mistakenly termed legatus in Gran. Lic. 35.75, ed. Criniti. In MRR 2.42, on his coinage, see also Crawford, RRC 1.545-546, no. 550, 88 B.C.? Crawford is uncertain regarding the place and date of the coinage, but associates it tentatively with the governor of Cilicia in 88. See now E. Badian, ?Q. Oppius Pr.,? ANSMusN 29, 1984, 99-102.[152x]
Pont. Max. See now Degrassi's comments on ILLRP 1274a and in Acta of the 5th Internat. Congress of Gr. and Lat. Epig., 155. A sarcophagus found in Rome at the Via Cristophoro Colombo and now in the Epigraphical Museum of the Capitoline Museum bears the inscription in early letters P. Cornelio P. f. Scapola pontfex (sic) max. This person is otherwise unknown, nor has the inscription been fully published. Degrassi notes that this inscription confirms that the Scapula known from Fast. Cap. as mag. eq. in 362 (MRR 2.118) may be a Cornelius, and supports the reading in Liv. 8.22.1, P. Cornelio Scapula, for the name of the consul of 328 (MRR 2.145** RE no. 316, cf. 315). See AEpig. 1967, no. 19, and J. M. Reynolds, JRS 61, 1971, 138-139. See now H. Blanck, Zwei Corneliersarcophage, MDAI(R) 73-74, 1968, 72-77.
The monetalis Palikanus, whose denarii with a tribune's bench or a curule chair on the reverse are now dated by Crawford (RRC 1.482, no. 473) to 45 (to 47 by others, MRR 2.444), may perhaps be identified with L. Lollius, a governor named on coins of Crete and Cyrenaica about 35 (so E. S. G. Robinson, BMC Catalogue, Cyrenaica, cciii, ccvii, 1141** cf. Grant, FITA 54-58), with more probability than with the senator, - f. Pob. Pallakeinos, whose name is partially preserved in the SC de Panamareis of 39, as suggested by TIC. See below, on M. Quinctius Plancinus (51), and Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 496** Historia 12, 1963, 137. He was earlier identified with Palikanus named on an aes coinage issued later than the Augustan reorganization of 23 (see G. Perl, Kho 52, 1970, 319-354, esp. 350** cf. MRR 2.498).
Praetor 217, 216, pro praetore in Ager Gallicus 215? And prorogued 214. See Liv. 22.7.7-8** 22.55.1** 24.10.3, cf. 44.3** MRR 1.244, 249, 256, 260. On the Pomponius, pro praetore at Suessula, who was summoned to aid Marcellus against Hannibal at Nola in 214 (Liv. 24.17.2** MRR 1.260), Weissenborn remarks that he may be M. Pomponius, above, diverted from his command to Suessula and Nola because of the emergency at a time when operations against the Gauls were not being pressed. But De Sanctis (Storia dei Romani 3.2.249, note 119** cf. pp. 247-249, 315, 350) holds that this unnecessary transfer of Pomponius from his assigned station at Ariminum to Suessula and Nola is nothing but late annalistic invention. He was succeeded in the Ager Gallicus in 213 by P. Sempronius Tuditanus (Liv. 24.44.3** MRR 1.263).
Cos. suff. 45. A legatus in 52 (MRR 2.238), Caninius can be assumed to be a senator and ex-quaestor (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 151). His praetorship in 48 remains uncertain (2.273), despite his proconsulate in 46, and consulate (suffect) in 45, since under Caesar examples occur of proconsuls and even consuls who have not been praetors (Sumner, op. cit., 251-254, 269, and Badian, Phoenix 25, 1971, 138-142). In MRR 2.297, on his proconsulate, add and received the surrender of both C. Vergilius (MRR 2.303) and the town. He may be the senator Rebilus, a supporter of Octavian who was captured and released by Sextus Pompey (App. BC 5.101, and Viereck's note). He should be distinguished from the C. Caninius Re[bil]us who founded Cephaloedium in Sicily (2.376), who may be RE no. 6. (TJC)
Tr. pl. 58** Antistius Vetus (47). Tr. pl. 56. The entry in MRR 2.195, 58 B.C., should be deleted and this tribune identified with Antistius Vetus (47). Tr. pl. 56 (MRR 2.209), as the one who attempted to prosecute Caesar then (Badian, CQ 19, 1969, 200-204** Salmon Studies 145-166** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 11- 13). Caesar, who was quaestor under an Antistius Vetus (46) in Hisp. Ult. in 69 (see MRR 2.132, 133), is reported to have made a son of this Antistius his quaestor in turn when he was in power (#, Plut. Caes. 5.3). This was not, as is often assumed, when he was proconsul in Hisp. Ult. himself in 61, but most probably when in 45 he appointed C. Antistius Vetus (47) to be quaestor pro praetore in Syria (MRR 2.308). This Antistius became consul suffectus in 30. See Shackleton Bailey, loc. cit.
Procos. Asia 58. The reading Ampio in Cic. Fam. 3.7.5 (cf 1.3.2) implies that Ampius Balbus, proconsul in Asia in 58-57, was also the immediate predecessor of Lentulus Spinther in Cilicia in 57-56. This cannot be due to the transfer of the three Phrygian dioceses from Asia to Cilicia at that time, for C. Fabius Hadrianus issued coins in Laodiceia and Apameia in that year (MRR 2.203) as proconsul in Asia. Magie (RRAM 1247) suggests that he received Cilicia the year after he was in Asia by a special grant, and Syme (CPh 50, 1955, 130** cf. Anat. Stud. Buckler 301) that this was arranged when Syria was substituted for Gabinius' original province of Cilicia, a better solution than the suggestion (MRR 2.197) that Ampio in Cic. Fam. 3.7.5 may be an error for Fabio. See Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.372.
A senator in the period of Marius and Sulla, very influential in the Senate and in the political intrigues of the decade of the 70s (Ps.-Ascon. on Verr. 2.2.8, 259St.** Plut. Luc. 5-6** Cic. Cluent. 84-86** and esp. Paradox. 5.40, a description which makes him comparable to a modern party boss). Probably son of the monetalis Cethegus (MRR 2.437** see Crawford, RRC 1.302-303, no. 288, 115 or 114 B.C.), he may have attained office before the Social War (Cic. Brut. 178** cf. Plut. Mar. 40.3** App. BC 1.60, 62, and 80** Sall. Hist. 1.77.20 M** Val. Max. 9.2.1). See L. R. Taylor, Party Politics 70** RS, MS-RP 1.279-280. Sumner credits this aequalis of Caesar Strabo qui in senatu consularium auctoritatem assequebatur (Cic. Brut. 178) with attainment at some time of a praetorship (Orators 106).
Cos. 129. Aed. Cur. 135. See MRR 1.489, 490, note 4. From Cic. Att. 13.32.3 it is clear that he attained his curule magistracies legitimis annis, but the aedileship is not proved. If he held it, 135 is the most probable year (Astin, Lex Annalis 9, notes 1-3). See Badian, Studies 145ff.** Sumner, Orators 46-47, 157, note 7, and cf. 6-10. Cos. 129. On his campaign against the Iapodes, the Bellum Histricum, see MRR 1.504, and now M. G. Morgan, Athenaeum 49, 1971, 271-301, and above, on T. Latinius Pandusa (6)** cf. J. J. Wilkes, Dalmatia 32-33. On the Tuditanus inscription found at Duino in the Venezia, see M. G. Morgan, Philologus 117, 1973, 29-48, attributing to him victories over the Taurisci, Carni, and Liburni** cf. also CIL 1_.652, and 2503** ILLRP 335, 334, resp.[190]
As a judicial Triumvir (Cic. Brut. 117, where Malcovati, ed., and Sumner both reject Schètz's emendation of triumviratu to tribunatu), he gave judgment, contrary to the testimony of Scipio Aemilianus, that augurs were not exempt from service on juries. The date must precede, perhaps by several years, the death of Scipio in 129, but is otherwise uncertain. See Niccolini, FTP 414f., but cf. Mommsen, StR 2?.600. Sumner suggests, although evidence is lacking, that he may have become tribune of the plebs ca. 132, and was sponsor of the Lex Aelia (AJPh 84, 1963, 347-348** Orators 70-71), but cf. Cic. Pis. 10 and Vat. 23, above, on Aelius (1). According to Cicero (Mur. 75-76), and Val. Max. (7.5.1), he was an unsuccessful candidate for the praetorship soon after Scipio's death.[4]
See MRR 2.56 and 59. Noting Fimbria's different titles in the sources, legatus in the Livian tradition (Liv. Per. 82** Auct. Vir. Ill. 70.1** Oros. 6.2.9** # in Dio, fr. 104, 1B), praefectus equitum (Veil. 2.24.1, probably in 87), and quaestor (Strabo 13.1.27), Lintott holds that he was probably the consul's quaestor, first of Marius, and then certainly of Valerius Flaccus (and in this capacity may have prosecuted Q. Mucius Scaevola, Cic. Rosc. Amer. 33). He had commanded cavalry in 87, and could have done so in 86. After the murder of Flaccus Fimbria claimed imperium, perhaps as proquaestor pro praetore (see Lintott, Historia 20, 1971, 696-701). Sumner (Orators 124) takes him to be a quaestor in 86 and a legatus in 85** see also Weinrib, Phoenix 22, 1968, 43, note 45.
Pr. 54? and Procos. Macedonia ca. 53-51. See MRR 2.230, 233, note 1. The inscription in question is published in IG III 4106 (MRR 2.230, and 233, note 1). Groag (Råm. Reichsbeamten von Achaia 14) dates it later than the Republic, and Oliver (AJPh 68, 1947, 151-152, and note** 69, 1948, 435) would place both it and the Marcellus inscription with which Broneer associates it in the Julio-Claudian period. (RS, CP) Badian (Gnomon 33, 1961, 496) finds 53-52 a probable date, and 53 or 52-51 is accepted by F. Papazoglou, ANRW 2.7.1, 1979, 311. Cosconius may still be identified with the ex-praetor who was killed in 47 (see MRR 2.273). Sumner agrees with 54 as a date for his praetorship, and would remove his name from the list of possible  praetors for 48 (Phoenix 25, 1971, 231).
Cos. 142. See MRR 1.474. A phrase in Livy Oxy. Per. 53, 142 B.C., line 167: M]etellus cos. a Lusitanis vex[atus est, has led several, including Simon (Kriege 80-82), although Metellus is not otherwise attested in Hisp. Ult., to consider him governor there in 142, succeeded in 141 by his colleague Fabius Maximus Servilianus (115). Astin cites the difficulties this raises (Historia 13, 1964, 249-254), and suggests the emendation procos., thus applying the reference to Metellus Macedonicus in Hisp. Cit. (MRR 2.475). In fact, Metellus Calvus may have been active in northeastern Italy at that time as the builder of the Via Caecilia (ILS 5799, 5810?ILLRP 465, 459), but Metellus Diadematus (93). Cos. 117, seems to be a more probable choice.
Cos. 38. Pr. 43. A. Alfåldi connects the gold coinage of L. Cestius (4) and C. Norbanus (9a), praetors in 43, with the legions, two from Africa and one raised in Italy, that were brought to defend Rome against Octavian in the summer of 43, but went on to join him (App. BC 3.92** Hermes 86, 1958, 480-496** and on Octavian, Syme, RR 181-186). For the view that the coinage may have been struck in Octavian?s interest, see Crawford, RRC 1.500-501, no. 491. Proconsul in Spain, 36-34. See MRR 2.402, 408, 412. On the possibility that he was the founder of Norbensis Caesarina (Caceres), see Garcia y Bellido, BRAH 158, 1966, 179-292, reported in Aepig. 1967, no. 199** H. Galsterer, Untersuchungen zum råmischen Stadtewesen auf der Iberischen Halbinsel 23-24.
Cos. suff. 23. Cite the full name in MRR 2.326, 349, 362. His filiation is given in Cic. Sect. 6-7, and in Fast. Cap., Degrassi, Inscr. Ital. 13.1, 59, 137, 514. The cognomen Quirinus appears in the mss readings of the title of Horace Carm. 1.4, but the correct form is given in CIL 15.1445, and in an inscription of Thasos (Dunant and Pouilloux, Etudes Thas. 5.2.55ff., no. 176, #), probably of the period when he was a proquaestor with Brutus in Macedonia. On his coinage then, see now Crawford, RRC 1.515, no. 503, 43-42 B.C. In MRR 2.349, correct 15.445 to 15.1445, and in 362, delete Pat. (RS, CP** TJC) On Sestius himself and his relations with Horace, see E. L. Will, Ambiguity in Horace Odes 1.4, CPh 77, 1982, 240-245.[197]
Cos. 54. Procos. Cilicia 53-51. The charges against Ap. Claudius in 51 were not res repetundae as stated in Auct. Vir. Ill. 82.4, but ambitus and maiestas (Cic. Fam. 3.11.1-3** 31.L Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.377-380** Gruen, LGRR 352, and note 194). Augur, by 63 to 48. A possible reference in Festus 462L. Procos. 48. Correct the statement in MRR 2.261 regarding his command in Greece, as Cic. Att. 8.15.3 shows that he did not have imperium when he left Italy in 49, and, as Shackleton Bailey points out, he could still have been censor at that time (CLA 5, 355). An inscription of Karystos confirms that he was proconsul in Achaea in 48 (H. J. Mason and M. B. Wallace, Hesperia 41, 1972, 128-140** cf. AJA 75, 1971, 208). Cf. MRR 2.276.
Cos. 112, Procos.? 111. The prosecution of Piso, apparently for extortions in Cisalpine Gaul (Cic. De Or. 2.265** cf. 2.285** and Pis. fr. 11C** see Gruen, RPCC 133-134) suggests that he held a command there as praetor or during his consulship and perhaps as proconsul in 111. The prosecution must precede his death in 107 in Transalpine Gaul (MRR 1.552). (RS, CP) Magius was his prefect (Cic. De Or. 2.265, 285) and the Gallus who was a witness against Piso may well represent, not a Gaul, but the cognomen of some member of a prominent Roman family, such as the Aquillii. Legatus under Cassius in Gallia Transalpina, 107. See MRR 1.552** and S. L. Dyson, Latomus 35, 1976, 356-362, on the importance of his service in Aquitania.[46x]
Pr. urb. 32, Cos. suff. 29. The name of the consul suffectus of 29 should be given as Potitus Valerius (M. f. M. n.) Messalla. See the edition of ILS 8694 by A. E. Gordon (Potitus Valerius Messalla 31-64), and R. Syme (JRS 45, 1955, 155-160-RP 1.260-270). He was also a XVvir s. f. before 31 (M. H. W. Lewis, Official Priests 49). Syme raises the possibility that a M'. Valerius Messalla Potitus named as quaestor (Taplas) in an inscription discovered at Claros by L. Robert may be this man (if he changed an original praenomen M'. to Potitus), but date and identification remain uncertain (Syme, op. cit. 156** Historia 5, 1956, 206?RP 1.317** Bull. Epig. 1956, no. 252). He should be listed among quaestors of uncertain date.
Tr. Pl. 66. See MRR 2.153. An attempt to continue his prosecution for res repetundae early in 65 was broken up, it seems, by disorders (Ascon. 60C, 65-66C** cf. Dio 36.44.1-2). Manilius failed to appear when prosecuted again de maiestate and was condemned in absentia (Ascon. 60C** Schol. Bob. 119St** cf. Schol. Gron. 322St). He probably is not the Manilius Crispus who was later attacked by Cn. Piso (Val. Max. 6.2.4)** see A. M. Ward, TAPhA 101, 1970, 550, note 17. For discussions and possible connections with  the ?first Catilinarian Conspiracy,? see E. J. Phillips, Latomus 29, 1970, 598-607** RhM 116, 1973, 353-357, with E. S. Gruen, CPh 64, 1969, 23. See also A. M. Ward, TAPhA 101, 1970, 545-556** B. A. Marshall, CPh 72, 1977, 318-320.
Pr. 73, propr.? 72. If the notice of his death in Schol. Gron. p. 224St (in 72 or 71) is incorrect, and there is no hint in Cic. Verr. 2.2.37 and 2.4.42 (or in other evidence, MRR 2.109 and 117) that he had been killed, it becomes possible to identify him with the base-born friend of Crassus (Cic. Brut. 242), and the potential candidate for the consulship of 58 (RE no. 8), who had in any case held a praetorship before 63 (MRR 2.161). He also gave the banquet which made Vatinius notorious (Schol. Bob. p. 149St). See RS, CP**  Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.328-329** Sumner, Orators 130** Wiseman, NM 214, no. 37** B. A. Marshall and R. Baker, Historia 24, 1975, 220-231. A. E. Douglas remains in favor of two men with the same name (Brutus 179** AJPh 87, 1966, 299).
Quaestor under Pompey, selected sine sorte (MRR 2.236, in 52). The comparison in Cic. Att. 6.6.4, with Caesar's selection of M. Antonius sine sorte refers only to method without implying the  same date** hence the quaestorship of Cassius may be dated in any year between the Lex Trebonia in 55 and 51, when Cassius returned to Rome, and may well have been under threat of prosecution for extortion, as his record in 49 and 48, again in Spain, suggests (Cic. Fam. 15.14.4, October 51, to C. Cassius, mentioning onera** Att. 5.20.8** cf. Shackleton Bailey, CLA 3.230-231** on his record, Bell. Alex. 48.1, 50.1** and on his quaestorship, see Linderski, CPh 70, 1975, 37-38). On his coinage, in MRR 2.435, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.452, no. 428, 55 B.C.
Mènzer assumed that Pandusa assisted Sempronius Tuditanus, Cos. 129, against the Iapodes (App. Illyr. 10) as governor of Macedonia, but it is difficult to see what effective aid he could have given when no link had been established by land (Wilkes, Dalmatia 32-33), and he is not included in the recent list of governors of Macedonia by F. Papazoglou in ANRW 2.7.1, 1979, 308-312. See M. G. Morgan (Athenaeum 49, 1971, 298-299, and Philologus 117, 1973, 32) for considerations suggesting that Pandusa may have been given command in Cisalpine Gaul and Istria as praetor in 130, and was active there in 129 until Tuditanus, Cos. 129, came to take command. He may then have continued with him, perhaps as legate, until the submission of the Iapodes.
Cos. 32. On his coinage as promagistrate and imperator, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.527, no. 519, 41 B.C., before he joined M. Antonius. He was honored at Ephesus as imperator and patron of the city and the temple, probably after 41 and before he was designated for the consulship (D. Knibbe, JOAI 49, 1968-1971, Beibl. 54-55, no. 21)** honored also at Samos (P. Herrmann, MDAI(A), 75, 1960, 138, no. 32). Cf. Herrmann, ZPE 14, 1974, 257** J. M. Reynolds, JRS 66, 1976, 178** Tuchelt, Frèhe Denkm•ler 1.143. Consul 32. The inscription of Glanum, once referred to the consuls of 96,(MRR 2.9), is now read TEUCER HIC FUIT | A. D. K. APRI[LES] | CN. DOMITIO C. SOSSIO | CO[S] and referred to the consuls of 32 (AEpig. 1958, no. 308).
Praetor 81. See MRR 2.76 and 447. Name and cognomen are assumed from the letters PR. L. v. P. F. and SEX. NONI on the issue of coins attributed to M. Nonius Sufenas, his son (RE no.  52), and now dated by Crawford, RRC 1.445-446, no. 421, to 59 (rather than 63 as in MRR 2.447). He interprets the inscription as Sex. Noni(us) Pr(aetor) L(udos) V(ictoriae) P(rimus) F(ecit). On these Ludi in honor of Sulla?s victory, see Vell. 2.27.6** CIL 1_.1, p. 333** Schol. Gron. 338St** App. BC 1.99** Degrassi, Inscr. Ital. 13.1.526. Crawford and Degrassi reject H. B. Mattingly?s proposal to read PR as PR(aeneste) and have the games performed there in the charge of the quaestors (NC 16, 1956, 189ff.). On the Nonii, see Shackleton Bailey, Studies 109-111.
He is ranked fifth in the consilium of at least fifty-five names listed in the SC de agro Pergameno (Sherk, RDGE no. 12, 63-73) and therefore was probably a praetorius. If the date was 129 (see MRR 1.496-497, note 1), he could still be identified with the prominent senator who visited Egypt in 112 (cf. MRR 1.539, note 5). It is probable also at the date (ca. 110) proposed by Cichorius, perhaps less so in 101, the date proposed by H. B. Mattingly (AJPh 93, 1972, 412-423, esp. 421), and F. de Martino (PP, fasc. 210, 1983, 161-190** cf. above, on the two Manii Aquilii, Coss. 129 and 101, resp.), a date when L. Memmius (L. f. Men.?) (13), the senior advisor of Livius Drusus, might be considered. See also Sumner, Orators 87 and 90.[141x]
Cos. 271. Because the praenomen K(aeso) appears in later generations of the Quinctii Flaminini, Badian suggests that this consul was the father, not brother as stated in RE, of L. Quinctius (42), the Flamen Dialis from whom later Quinctii derived their cognomen (JRS 61, 1971, 102-111). See his reconstruction of the stemma of the family of T. Flamininus, Cos. 198, and his early career (op. cit.). Leg., envoy, 264. See MRR 1.203. Badian suggests that since the praenomen Kaeso does not appear among the Fabii after the fourth century, and the speakers in the Ineditum Vaticanum were prominent persons, the Kaeso mentioned there was the K. Quinctius named above (CR 14, 1964, 139-140** JRS 61, 1971, 102-111).[178x]
Cos. 153. Treated as two persons, father and son, in both RE and MRR (1.413, 426, 447, 452, and Index, 2.530), he should be treated as one, since the junior and the senior offices attributed to the two can reasonably be held within the period of one career (Badian, Studies 248** Malcovati in ORF_ 104** Sumner, Orators 40). Note that T. P. Wiseman, though without full proof that the Via Annia from Bononia through Patavium and Altinum to Aquileia precedes the building of the Via Postumia from Genua to Aquileia in 148, is inclined to attribute it to the consul of 153 rather than, with Degrassi, to T. Annius Rufus, Cos. 128, Pr. by 131 (PBSR 32, 1964, 21-37** 37, 1969, 82-91). See below, on T. Annius Rufus (78). Cos. 128.
Cos. 116. Proconsul in Macedonia 115-114. He was probably the proconsul of Macedonia who addressed a letter to the Dymaeans after the occurrence of disorders there (SIG? 684** Sherk, RDGE 246-248, no. 43** see Accame, Dominio romano in Grecia 9, 33f., 149- 152). Since the other Fabii Maximi known in this generation held commands after their consulates, in Spain and Gaul, it is preferable to return to the attribution of Zumpt and Geyer (RE s.v. Macedonia 774) of-Macedonia to Eburnus (above) in 115-114. See Mènzer, RE, Supb. 3.640** F. Papazoglou, ANRW 2.7.1, 1979, 310. It was perhaps at the end of this command that he was sent in 113 to head a commission to Crete (MRR 1.536, 537, note 5).[87x]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.445, and Index, 588, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.448-449, no. 425, 56 B.C. Crawford would identify him with the suffect consul of 38 (RE no. 77), in spite of the interval, rather than Q. Marcius (83), procos. in Cilicia in 47-46. Praetor 44. See MRR 2.322. Refer also to Cic. Fam. 12.2.2, and Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.482. Augur. See MRR 2.426** cf. 255. The lituus on his coinage may refer to an ancestor, as 56 is rather early for him to gain this priesthood. Note that his name, and that of P. Servilius Isauricus the younger, are not included in the list in Cicero, Att. 9.9.3 (cf. Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.375). On his identification and career, see Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 252-254.[138x]
Sumner (Orators 85-86) points out that their probable ages are a consideration against identifying the tr. Mil. of 134 (MRR 1.491) with the tr. Pl. of 111 (MRR 1.541) and the pr. by 103 (1.559, 562, note 4). The date of his praetorship is quite uncertain but should not precede 107 (Sumner, loc. Cit.). He may be identified with a proconsul, almost certainly of Macedonia, in the later years of the second century. See MRR 1.564, 566, note 9, and RE no. 3. Sumner takes C. Memmius, Quaestor 76 (RE no. 7), to be his son, and C. Memmius C. f., monetalis in 57-56 and tr. Pl. in 54 (RE no. 9** MRR 2.223), to be his grandson. See the stemma (Sumner, op. cit. 87** and Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum, stemma, 65, and p. 69, notes 19 and 20).
Cos. 171. L. Robert recognized the name of this consul in a fragment of a decree of the Senate which affected Coronea, and is probably of about the same date (170 B.C.) as the SC de Thisbensibus (Etudes epig. et phil. 287-292** cf. P. Meloni, Perseo 263-265). See Sherk, RDGE 32-33, no. 3** and, on Thisbe, SIG? 646** Sherk, RDGE 26-29, no. 2. See now a recently discovered in scription of Larisa of Thessaly, in which honors are given to two associates of Eumenes II and Attalus of Pergamum, present at the time of Publius, general of the Romans, i.e., P. Licinius Crassus, Consul in Thessaly in 171, at the beginning of the war with Perseus (K. I. Gallis, Analecta A. A. 13, 2, 1980, 246-249 and 261-262). See MRR 1.416.
Pr. -. Quaestor in Macedonia, honored by the Italicei of Aigion in Achaea (J. Bingen, BCH 78, 1954, 83-85?ILLRP 370), perhaps as early as 87 under C. Sentius, if he was praetor by 74 (Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 492-493). Leg., envoy 85. Perhaps the Rutilius whom Sulla sent to negotiate with Fimbria (App. Mith. 60** see above, *Rutilius). If he was a praetor by 74, as Mènzer suggests (RE), he was a senior officer when he served as # with special responsibility under M. Aurelius Cotta at Chalcedon in 73 (or 74?) (MRR 2.105** named as Nudus in App. Mith. 71, P. Rupilius in Oros. 6.2.13, and Rutilius Nudus in Ascon. 5C). He was father-in-law of L. Ca1purnius Piso (90). Cos. 58 (Fenestella fr. 22P** Ascon. 5C). (RS, CP)[183]
Cos. Suff. 45. Shackleton Bailey (CLF 2.434) suggests that he also had the agnomen Sanga (see Fam, 7.30.1** CLA 1.348** and cf. RE no. 143, and MRR 2.490). The connection of Q. Fabius Sanga with the Allobroges (Sall. Cat. 41.2-3) suggests that he was a descendant of Allobrogicus  (110). Cos. 121. His praetorship is listed under 48 (MRR 2.273), the latest legal date. Caesar did advance some (e.g., M. Antonius and P. Cornelius Dolabella) to the consulship without holding the praetorship, but it would be strange after the distinction of Fabius' curule aedileship in 57 (MRR 2.201), if he had not reached the praetorship well before 48,, like several of his contemporaries. See Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 251-252.
Senator in 73 (see MRR 2.115). This praenomen, said to have been banned among the patrician Claudii, suggests that he was perhaps father of L. Claudius, rex sacrorum in 57 (21) who had become a member of the college of pontifices ca. 62-60. The name of the preceding rex sacrorum is lost in the lacuna in Macrob. Sat. 3.13.11, but he entered office between 74 and 69. L. R. Taylor (VDRR 203) has suggested that since the succession was often in the same family, there may be here a branch of the patrician Claudii kept for this priesthood which barred one from a further political career. If so, the Claudius listed above owed his place in the Senate and in the consilium of 73, not to a quaestorship but to his priesthood.
Procos. Asia? 32-31. Grant (FITA 373, and 3951.) reads # on a unique coin of Alabanda in Berlin with a portrait of Cleopatra (Imhoof-Blummer thought it was Livia), and would identify T. Octavius as a relative of M. Octavius (34), the naval commander at the battle of Actium (MRR 2.442), and suggests that he was proconsul of Asia in 32-31. As in the case of Asinius, no title is preserved (2.411). Grant notes that the custom of dating local magistrates in Greek cities arose somewhat later. The praenomen T. is rare in the Octavian gens, and both the identification of the figures on the coin and the reading remain unconfirmed. Perhaps he was a local magistrate of Alabanda with the name T. Octavius Cleomenes or Cleandros.
Monetalis. See MRR 2.456, and Index, 635, with the formerly accepted supplement Vol(teius), dated to 82-81. He is dated to 81 by Crawford, RRC 1.391, no. 377. He may be the L. Volumnius L. f. Ani., above. probably a tr. mil., named in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo at Asculum (Cichorius, RS 150, 152** Wiseman, NC 1964, 158** N. Criniti, L'Epigrafe di Asculum 113114). He may also be identified with the senator Volumnius (RE no. 4) in Varro, RR 2.4.11 (the dramatic date of the dialogue is 67 B.C.), and perhaps, too, with the senator Volumnius mentioned in Cicero's letter (Fam. 7.32.1) to Volumnius Eutrapelus, although its date is in 50. See Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 142** Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.451-452.
Senator in 49? The entry should probably read C. Sentius C. f. Sab. (4, see 9), unless there is a lacuna in Joseph. AJ 14.220. As he is listed last in the consilium of the consul in 49 (Joseph. AY 14.229), he was probably not yet a senator (cf. the position of the tr. mil. in the list in AJ 14.229), but was almost certainly a tr. mil. Mènzer identifies him with Saturninus (see 9), the envoy in 40 (MRR 2.384** App. BC 5.52) and with Sentius Saturninus Vetulo (see 9), named in Val. Max. 7.3.9 (but cf. App. BC 4.45, where a similar story is told of a Pomponius), and with the father of C. Sentius C. f. C. n. Saturninus (9). Cos. 19 (see Groag, RE no. 9). In MRR 2.384, read (Sentius) Saturninus (Vetulo) (see 4 and 9). (TJC) '
On the apparent confusion between the names L. Furius (18, cf. 2) and L. Turius (2) for the praetor in 75 who had charge of the quaestio de repetundis, see MRR 2.97. There is manuscript authority for the reading Turium in Cic. Att. 1.1.2 (turium #** Torium Zb** Curum M** carum MSO** CLA 1.126) and hence for the man who was both praetor before 67 and as candidate for the consulship of 64 lacked only a few centuries for election (Cic. Brut. 237). Mènzer, accepting him as praetor in 75, favors a candidacy between 73 and 71. See however Syme, RR 81** CPh 50, 1955, 134** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.292-293, with examples of along interval between praetorship and candidacy for the consulship. See Wiseman, NM 167, note 1** 267, no. 448.[209x]
Aedile ca. 120, or ca. 94. If he was a colleague of the elder M. Livius Drusus (17), Tr. pl. 122, whose aedileship is not attested, the date would be between 122 and 115. See Wiseman, NM 250, no. 356. Mènzer holds that there is no need to doubt the notice that Remmius was a colleague of the younger Drusus in his aedileship, because the office, though mentioned in the Auct. Vir. Ill. 66.1, is not mentioned in the Elogium, since it could easily have been omitted in our single sixteenth-century copy of it (Mommsen, CIL 1_.199)
Praetor in Sicily 138? The order and the chronology of the praetors who dealt unsuccessfully with the first slave revolt in Sicily remains uncertain, since there were lesser disorders and defeats in the years before C. Fulvius Flaccus was sent to take command as consul in 134. Against the order accepted in MRR (1.483, note 1), P. Green would place Hypsaeus, not in 138, but in 135, since the situation described by Diodorus (34-35.2.16-18) fits best with the crisis just before the consul was sent. The others, Popillius, Cornelius Lentulus, and Calpurnius Piso (see the names in MRR, Index) remain uncertain as before. See P. Green, Past and Present, no. 20, 1960-1961, 10-29, and the chronological note, 28-29.
Cos. 69. Wiseman has suggested that the Q. Metellus who was a tr. pl. one year and leg. the next (Cic. Leg. Man. 58) may be Metellus Creticus, and that he was tr. pl. in 82 and leg. in 81. But cf. above, on Metellus Celer (86). Cos. 60. Praetor. The pr. urb. mentioned in Val. Max. 7.7.7. may have been Creticus, Pr. between 74 and 72 (MRR 2.102, 108, note 3), not Celer (86), Pr. 63 (2.166). See above, no. 88. Food riots were more common before the Lex frumentaria of 72 (Sall. Hist. 2.45 M** see R. Seager, CR 20, 1970, 11). See also B. W. Frier, Urban Praetors and aural Violence, TAPhA 113, 1983, 224, 229, 233, who brings further support for dating his urban praetorship to 73 B.C.
A senator, probably of praetorian rank, since he is named fifth in the list of witnesses in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome, Document 8, and figure 5, pp. 57 and 68-69** cf. Sherk, RDGE no. 29, now superseded by the new discoveries and rearrangement of the inscribed stones). As Syme noted previously when the praenomen was unknown (CPh 50, 1955, 133** Historia 4, 1955, 56-57-RP 2.275-276), several nomina may be considered, such as Lucilius, above, Octavius, Paccius, and even in spite of the difference in the cognomen, L. Saenius Balbinus, Cos. suff. in 30. But Saenius is less probable since it is short for the available space (Reynolds, op. cit. 69).
Cos. 53, 40. For his tribe, Men., see the treaty with Cnidus (A. Jarde, Mel. R. Cagnat 51-58** T•ubler, Imperium Romanum 1.450-451), in which he, along with Q. Pompeius Rufus, took oath on behalf of the state. Consul 40. See MRR 2.378. Refer also to the two fragmentary inscriptions of Ampurias with his name and that of his colleague, C. Asinius Pollio (A. Degrassi, MAL 13, 1, 1967, 38-40** ILLRP 1173** cf. A. d'Ors, Acta 5th Internat. Congress Gr. and Lat. Epig. 255** and see now G. Alfåldy, AEA 50-51, 1977-1978, 46-55): Cos. II, Imp., and patron of Ampurias. Procos. Spain 39-36. On his coinage, see MRR 2.388, and refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.533-534, no. 532, 39 B.C.
IIIvir col. deduc. 313. See MRR 1.159. R. D. Weigel in a paper entitled Roman Colonial Commissioners and Prior Service (presented at the Annual Meeting of the Am. Philol. Assoc., December 1982) notes (1) that there is only one other Publius and no other Longus recorded in the Fulvian gens, and (2) that the Romans tended to select persons with prior experience in the region to serve on colonial commissions. He suggests, in place of the above, L. Fulvius Curvus (46), cos. 322, who had won a triumph over the Samnites, and had besieged Saticula in 316 (MRR 1.149-150, and 157). The commission, however, as reported in Festus (458L) conforms to the regular pattern of two seniors and one younger member.
Quaestor, probably before 80, if the danger from which he rescued Interamna Nahars was confiscation of land by Sulla (CIL 1_.2510-ILS 6629?ILLRP 364) . He accompanied his brother Bithynicus to Bithynia in 74, probably as legatus (SIG? 1125), and may be one of the Pompei iuvenes listed by Florus (1.41.9-10) as legati of Pompey in 67 (MRR 2.149** cf. Cichorius, RS 188). See below, on Q. Pompeius Bithynicus (25). His branch of the Pompeii took the cognomen Bithynicus (Cichorius, RS 185-190), and being of the Clustumina tribe were more closely related to the Magni than to the Rufi in the Arnensis. (LRT) On him and succeeding Pompeii, see Sumner, ?The Pompeii in Their Families,? AJAR 2, 1977, 8-25.
He was probably one of the aedilicii among the legati of L. Piso in Macedonia in 57-55 (Cic. Pis. 88, quaestor aediliciis reiectis praepositus** see MRR 2.204, 212), and so was an aedile by or before 58. Sumner has shown that there is no need to assume that he had been praetor before becoming proconsul in Bithynia-Pontus by Caesar?s appointment in 45, and that in 46 he was more probably a legatus under Caesar in Africa than a military tribune (Phoenix 25, 1971, 269** cf. MRR 2.295, and 299, correcting the praenomen to Q.). He might have been a praetor as early as 54, and there is a possibility that he was the suffect consul of 36 (MRR 2.399). See also Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 135, and RR 199, note 3.
Legatus of Q. Sertorius in Spain (MRR 2.95, 121). Cichorius would identify this Tarquitius with the C. Tarquitius L. f. Fal. who was no. 37 in Pompeius Strabo's consilium in 89 (RS 167), and has been accepted by Mènzer (RE), by L. R. Taylor, who explains the occurrence of the Falerna tribe in a Tarquinian family as due to a grant of Roman citizenship before the Social War (VDRR 257-258** Tarquinii was in Stellatina), and recently by Criniti, L Epigrafe di Asculum 144-146. The problem of an Etruscan Tarquitius in the Falerna tribe led Heurgon to identify the two Tarquitii named above, and to assume that Annius' quaestor went over to Sertorius (Latomus 12, 1953, 407-408** Wiseman, NM 264, no. 420).
See MRR 2.492. His position (no. 7) in the list in the SC de agro Pergameno (Sherk, RDGE no. 12), dating most probably from 129 (Sherk, op. cit.** L. R. Taylor, VDRR 222** but cf. H. B. Mattingly, AJPh 93, 1972, 412-423), indicates that he was then of praetorian rank, son of the consul of 157 and father of the consul of 90. He may still be identified with the monetalis L. Iuli (29), whom Crawford dates to 141 (RRC 1.260, no. 224), but rejects because of the lack of the cognomen Caesar and of types characteristic of the Iulii Caesares. See the stemma in Sumner, CPh 71, 1976, 341344, correcting the one in Phoenix 25, 1971, 264. On the date, see above, on M'. Aquillius (10).
Praefectus fabrum. See MRR 2.377. Syme suggested that he may possibly have served as piaefectus fabrum under Asinius Pollio in 41-40 when he was governing the Cisalpina for Antonius (RR 252, and note 4). The underlying inscription on the Vatican obelisk, which F. Magi discovered and deciphered, shows that he served in this office under Octavian, quite possibly in 31 even before Actium, and certainly in 30 when he approached Egypt from the west by way of the Cyrenaica and received the surrender of L. Pinarius Scarpus and his legions (Dio 51.9.1-4** Syme RR 298** cf. MRR 2.422). On the inscription, see F. Magi, StudRom 11, 1963, 50-56** G. Guadagno, Opuscula Romana 6, 1968, 21-26.
Pr. 141. M. G. Morgan would date his command in Macedonia to 142-141 (Historia 23, 1974, 195198) because more time is needed before early in 140 to prepare and bring a case against him. If so, the praetorship of .Licinius Nerva and the suppression of Pseudophilippus by his quaestor L. Tremellius Scrofa would have to be dated to 143 (see MRR 1.472, 473, note 2, and 475** Morgan, op. cit.). In addition, the disaster suffered at the hands of the Scordisci in 141 (Liv. Oxy. Per. 54) may be connected with the severe defeat reported in App. Illyr. 14, of a certain Cornelius by the Pannonians (Morgan, op. cit. 183-216** see above, on Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio [354], Cos. 138).
Cos. 79. Pr. 90? Badian suggests that in this period of prolonged provincial commands his praetorship and his command may have been as early as 93 and 92, respectively. Sardinia is a probable praetorian province, especially if Sextilius was in Africa before 88. See[196] Badian, Studies 82-84. Procos. Cilicia, 78-74. In MRR 2.99, 75 B.C., refer also to Alan S. Hall, New Light on the Capture of Isaura Vetus by P. Servilius Vatia, Akten des VI. Internaz. Kongr. fèr gr. u. lat. Epig. 568-571, on an inscription discovered at Bozkir with the name and title Servilius C. f. Imperator, the phrase Isaura vetere capta, and evidence of Roman use of evocatio there.
Pr. by 48. He was one of two ex-praetors, Galba and Cosconius (see above on no. 55), who were murdered by Caesar's mutinous legionaries in 47 (Plus. Caes. 51.5** cf. Dio 42.52.2). He cannot be identified with no. 52, the historian and grandfather of the future emperor, who attained the praetorship in the late Republic (see MRR 2.465), since the latter was a son of Caesar's legate and murderer (no. 61), who had held the praetorship as late as 54 and survived until 43. Galba might possibly be the monetalis (no. 20, see 2.453), or the senator (no. 21) who was with Juba in 49 (2.497** Caes. BC 2.44.3), but neither of these was demonstrably a Galba. (RS, CP** TJC** and see above on no. 55)
Pr. 107? Legatus before 100. In MRR 2.482 (cf. 1.551, 552, note 3), refer now to Schleussner, Legaten, 228, no. 80. He is termed legatus in I. de Delos 4.1.1710 (#), but in 4.1.1854 appears as #** cf. ILLRP 358, where Degrassi explains it as praetor pro consule Asiae. He did hold a praetorship, for Cicero claims he would have become consul if the successive consulships of Marius had not removed the opportunity (Brut. 175). F. Papazoglou lists him with Ser. Cornelius Lentulus (208b) (I. de Delos 4.1.1845) and C. Cluvius (2) (ibid. 1679) as possibly governors of Macedonia, but agrees that Asia is possible too (ANR W 2.7.1, 1979, 310-311** see also ZAnt 29, 1979, 227-249).[34x]
Proquaestor in Crete and Cyrene, 43, 42. See MRR 2.342, 360. R. D. Weigel (CPh 73, 1978, 42-45) presents the possibility that the P. of the praenomen of P. Lepidus named as proquaestor under Brutus may stand for Paullus and identify him as a son of the consul of 50, L. Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (81), Paullus Aemilius L. f. M. n. Paullus (82), the future consul suffectus of 34. Syme suggested that as the praenomen P. was not in use among the known Aemilii Lepidi, the nomen of P. Lepidus remains uncertain, but he might be an Aemilius adopted into another gens (Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 133). On the governor of Cyrene, see G. Perl, Klio 52, 1970, 319-354, esp. 336-338.
Cos. 195. Leg., lieut. or Tr. Mil. 191. In MRR 1.354 and 355, refer also to Phlegon Trall. 3.3, FGrH 2B, no. 257, p. 1174** Zon. 9.19.9** Astin, Cato the Censor 55-59 (tr. Mil.)** Kienast, Cato der Zensor 48-50 (legatus). Augur. See MRR 1.457, and Cic. Sen. 64. The dramatic date of De Senectute is 150, but, if Cato was an augur, he must have been coopted many years before. The crucial point is whether the correct reading in Sen. 64 is in nostro collegio (BS) or in vestro collegio (L3). In the latter case he was addressing Laelius and Scipio Aemilianus (330), who might possibly, but not at all certainly, have become augurs by that date. The text tradition seems to favor nostro.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.450, and Index, 609, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.396, no. 279, 80 B.C. Perhaps also the Procilius (senator?) mentioned in Cic. QF 2.7(6).1, and Cic. Att. 2.2.2 (see Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.353-354). The name of L. Procilius should be deleted from the list of tribunes of 56 (MRR 2.209). Though prosecuted at the same time as C. Cato and Sufenas, he was accused of murder and tried in a different court (Cic. Att. 4.15.4), with no indication that he had held office (Linderski, Studi E. Volterra 2.281-283). He may not be the Procilius named above. Cf. Wiseman, NM 254, no. 343. See above, on C.  Porcius Cato (6), and M. Nonius Sex. f. Sufenas (52).
Quaestor or legate in Cilicia 47-46, named in the headings of two letters of Cicero (Fam. 13.43 and 44). According to Shackleton Bailey (Studies 62-63), In the first letter the mss are divided between Quintio Gallio and Quinto Gallo, in the second they all have simply Gallio. He grants that the heading favored by Mènzer and Gundel in RE, Quintio Gallo and Gallo, may be right, thus giving the name Quin(c)tius (49), but a praenomen is required. If the right heading is Q. Gallio, he may be identified with the praetor who was demoted and condemned to death by Octavian in 43 (MRR 2.338). See Syme, Anat. Stud. Buckler 315** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 52-63** cf. CLF 1.269, 270.[98x]
Cos. 137. See MRR 1.472. As the passage in Frontin. Aq. 1.7 makes no mention of praetors and deals primarily with actions of a M. Lepidus who was a member of the college of Xviri s. f., and as Porcina is attested a member of the college of augurs by or before 125 B.C. (see MRR 1.511, cf. 496), the evidence for Porcina's praetorship in 143 disappears, and the consul of 158, M. Aemilius M'. f. M'. n. Lepidus (70) should be accepted as the Xvir s. f. active in 143 (see above** Sumner, Orators 47-48** cf. MRR 1.473, note 1). Porcina must have been praetor by 140 in any case, and may well be the praetor M. Aemilius M. f. named in Sherk, RDGE no. 7.
Cos. 48, 41. See Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 140-141, on which of these two (more probably the former) is named in the SC quoted in Joseph. AJ 14.220** cf. L. R. Taylor, VDRR 257. Ser. Sulpicius Ser. f. Rufus Pat. (96). Son of the jurist, perhaps a senator in 43. Cicero attributes his absence from the meeting of the Senate in honor of his father to grief (Phil. 9.12). He may have survived Philippi, and continued as husband of Messalla's sister, father of the poetess Sulpicia, and himself a poet (Jerome, Adv. Iovin. 1.46, from Seneca, De matrimonio, ed. Haase 3, p. 432, 77** Hor. Sat. 1.10.85-86** Ovid Trist. 2.441** Plin. Ep. 5.3.5). (RS, MS-RP 1.289-290)
Cos. 180. Leg., lieut. 191. See MRR 1.355. Mènzer (no. 46) suggests that Livy 36.12.9 should be emended to read either ab A. Postumio legato, qui ab Atilio Cephallaniae praepositus fuerat or, with Perizonius, qui ab Atilio legatus Cephallaniae praepositus fuerat. He should be listed as above. Leg., amb. 175. See MRR 1.403. This embassy must have left Italy for Macedonia in the spring or early summer of 176 and, while some members of it visited the Bastarni, returned to Rome in 175 (P. Meloni, Perseo 82 and note 3, 83, 85 and notes 2 and 3** see also Walbank, Comm. Polyb. 3.281-283). Censor, 174. In MRR 1.404, refer also to Liv. 45.17.1.
A witness to the SC de Aphrodisiensibus of 39 B.C. (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 57, 68-69). Viereck (no. 19, p. 40) supplied the gentilicium Attius (for M. Atius Balbus), but Syme[33] suggested consideration of Lucilius, Octavius, and Paccius, and perhaps of Saenius, who was Cos. suff. in 30 (RS, CP 133** RS, MS 56-57-RP 2.275-276), but for Saenius, Degrassi, though omitting him from the text of I fasti consolari dell?Impero romano (Rome, 1952), suggests in the Index (p. 224) the cognomen Balbinus. Syme has since proposed L. Lucilius Balbus (Reynolds, loc. cit.). See RE no. 19, on the occurrence of the family and the cognomen, and see Syme, RP 1.28-3-284.
Cos. suff. 30. The suffect consul of 30 must have been a senator before 31. He was probably a son of the senator of 63 (MRR 2.496). Appian mentions a Balbinus, one of the proscribed, who returned after the pact of Misenum in 39 and later became consul** his attitude at the time of the conspiracy of Lepidus in 30, as told by Appian (BC 4.50), justifies identifying him with the suffect consul. See above, on the senator named in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus in 39, L. (Attius? or Lucilius? or Saenius?) L. f. Ouf. Balbus (Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 133** J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 57, Document no. 8, 68-69** see also E. Wistrand, Horace's Ninth Epode 15-16).
Senator 39 (not in 35) (MRR 2.496). Both notices refer to the same person, and the reading of the text in the SC de Panamareis is Sestuillius (Sherk, RDGE no. 27, 258-262). The name has been fully established as Sestullius, both in the manuscripts of Cicero's Pro Flacco (see 84, 89, and elsewhere** cf. Schol. Bob. 106St) and in a considerable number of inscriptions of Phrygia of Asia Minor (S. Mitchell, A Roman Family in Phrygia, AS 29, 1979, 13-22** Badian, A Fundus at Fundi, AJPh 101, 1980, 470-482). Of the tribe the letters # are preserved in the text of the SC** it may be Oufentina or Tromentina (cf. L. R. Taylor, VDRR 255).
Senator before 35. In Hor. Sat. 1.6.24-25 (cf. 106-111), written before 35, there is mention of a Tillius who had regained the senatorial stripe he had lost and had attained the tribunate. Porphyrio (ad loc.) explains it as restoration to senatorial rank after Caesar's death. A demand for restoration from exile of a brother of L. Tillius Cimber (5) was used to begin the attack on Caesar on the Ides of March (Nic. Dam. Vit. Aug. 24, FGrH 2A, p. 408** Plut. Caes. 66.3** Brut. 17.2** App. BC 2.117). It is difficult to believe that a brother of one of Caesar's murderers would have been advanced under the triumvirate, but he might have returned in 44 and become a tribune in 43.
Cos. suff. 43: See MRR, Index, 2.362, and the years listed there. His tribunate might precede 45 (see MRR 2.308). Caesar enrolled him in the Senate, probably late in 47 or in 46 (Gell. 15.4.3** cf. Dio 43.51.5). In MRR 2.388, 39 B.C. and 393, 38 B.C., note that he issued coins in the East under the command of Mark Antony, IIIvir r. p. c. (Crawford, RRC 1.533, no. 531, 39 B.C.), inscribed PONT. IMP. On his origins, status, and career, see Gell. 15.4.3** Cic. Fam. 10.18.3** Plin. NH 7.135** Syme, Latomus 17, 1958, 63- 80-RP 1.395-399, not Sabinus ille of Catalepton 10** Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 141-142** L. R. Taylor, VDRR 264** Wiseman, NM 271-272, no. 474.
Pr. 44. In MRR 2.321, delete the word perhaps, as his claim is as good as that of the others in Cic. Phil. 3.25. Sumner notes that he may be a son of Lentulus Niger (234), candidate for the consulship of 58 (Cic. Vat. 25), in which case his filiation was probably L. f. L. n., or else a  son of Lentulus Crus (218), consul 49, and his filiation would be L. f. P. n. The cognomen Cruscellio (Val. Max. 6.6.3** cf. Cruscello in the Chron. of 354 on the cos. suff. of 38 [MRR 2.390]), if it is his, would favor the latter view. See Sumner, Orators 142-143, with a stemma which distinguishes the two, but see also Phoenix 25, 1971, 365.
Cos. 198. Quaestor. In Livy 32.7.9, he is described as a candidate for the consulship ex quaestura, but there is no record of the date (see MRR 1.329, note 2). Badian would place it after his military tribunate under the consul Marcellus in 208 (MRR 1.293) and before he was placed in command at Tarentum in 205 with imperium pro praetore (1.308). See Badian, JRS 61, 1961, 109, probably in 206. Proconsul, Greece and Macedonia, 197194. In MRR 1.336-337, refer to the gold coinage in Greece, Crawford, RRC 1.544, no. 548, 196 B.C. He was also honored by Phanoteus of Phocis (G. Klaffenbach, Chiron 1, 1971, 167-168** AEpig. 1972, 571).[179x]
Cos. 141. In MRR 1.477, refer also to Vell. 2.21.5. On his special command in 133 to suppress a slave rising at Sinuessa and Minturnae, see Oros. 5.9.4, and above, on Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus (94). Cos. 143. See Badian, Studies 37. Censor 125. Because of the long delay between his consulship and his censorship, L. Hayne suggests that he was a candidate in 131, but was defeated by Pompeius (12) (Historia 27, 1978, 234-235). Badian suggests that the consul Scipio who pulled down L. Cassius' theater (App. BC 1.28) was not the consul of 106 (49) but the censor of 125 with L. Cassius Longinus Ravilla (72) (CR 9, 1959, 274).
Cos. 252. A milestone, discovered at Zaccharone in Sicily, on the road from Agrigentum to Panormus, with the inscription [C. Au]relius | [L. f.] Cotta | [C]onsol LVII, by A. di Vita (Kokalos 1, 1955, 10-21-AEpig. 1957, no. 172). Degrassi doubts so early a date, though he favors one not later than the second century and suggests that a later Cotta, perhaps L. Aurelius Cotta (98). Cos. 144, honored his ancestor in this way (Hommages a Albert Grenier 1.499-506). See now Degrassi ILLRP 1277, and Acta 5th Epig. Congress, Cambridge, 1967 169-170, with discussions cited there. Refer also to G. P. Verbrugghe, Itinera Romano, Bd. 2: Sicilia 19-23.
Senator in 129 (no. 9 in the consilium listed in the SC de agro Pergameno in copy B, no. 24 in copy A). See Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73. The praenomen of the father of no. 5 appears in the text tradition of Josephus as # possibly a corruption of Cnaeus, but this praenomen is improbable since the Sempronii of the Republic do not use it. More probably these two Sempronii may be identified. As none of the known Gracchi or Tuditani of the period appear to fit, he may be a Sempronius Longus, son of the Xvir s. f. of 174 (no. 63** MRR 1.406), and father of the legatus of ca. 96 (no. 64** MRR 2.10). But on the date, see above, on M?. Aquillius (10).
Cos. Suff. 86. Aedile in 98 (or 99), he may have become praetor in 95 (or 96?) and then proceeded to his proconsulate in Asia in 94 or 95 (MRR 2.18-19** Sumner, GRBS 19, 1978, 147-153). Badian rejected identifying this Flaccus with the one whose quaestor M. Aurelius Scaurus attempted to prosecute and would identify him with no. 176, Cos. 100, but has now reversed his view (Klio 66, 1984, 298- 301). See above. Cos. suff. 86. As his death did not occur until early in 85 he should be included in MRR 2.58- 59 among the promagistrates of that year (Badian, Studies 102, note 117** Sumner, Orators 124** Lintott, Historia 20, 1971, 701).
Senator in 43. He was proscribed in 43 but was saved by his wife and his freedman, T. Vinius Philopoemen, being hidden in a chest in the latter's house (Suet. Aug. 27.2** App. BC 4.44** Dio 47.7.4-5). Augustus rewarded him with equestrian rank. Vinius was probably of senatorial rank, and may have attained the praetorship. According to Tacitus (Hist. 1.48), the father of T. Vinius Rufinus (PIR 3.437, no. 450** De Laet 170, no. 1157), born A.D. 21/22, belonged to a praetorian family, and his grandfather also, but Tacitus (Hist. 1.48) writes that his maternus avus was one of the proscribed. (TJC) See Syme, Sallust 228, note 52** Wiseman, NM 275, no. 496.[221x]
See MRR 2.632, Index, and under the years listed there. On his second praetorship (in 66, not 65) and his proconsulate in Asia (65, not 64), see MRR 2.142, note 9, and insert at line 12 of the note the following two lines which were omitted by mistake in the first printing: his praetorship (that of Aufidius)  should not be dated later than 66 and his command in Asia than 65. But since Varinius was his immediate successor (Cic. Flacc. 45) and the governors of 64 and afterwards are known, his praetorship should be placed in 67 and that of Varinius in 66, his command in Asia in 66 and that of Varinius in 65. Lange . . . . See Wiseman, NM 270, no. 462.
Legatus 77. See MRR 2.91. His position as legatus in Cisalpine Gaul of M. Aemilius Lepidus, who apparently had command of both Transalpine and Cisalpine Gaul (Badian, Foreign Clientelae 275, note 8** MR. Piganiol 910-911), is presented by Plut. Pomp. 16, though without a title. The phrases # in Plutarch and qui Cisalpinam Galliam obtinebat in Livy (Per. 90** cf. Oros. 5.24.16) might suggest an independent command, but there is no evidence that he had been praetor, an office he could hardly have held before 78 (Sumner, Orators 114). On his tribunate in 83 and foundation of Capua (MRR 2.63), see also P. B. Harvey, Athenaeum 60, 1982, 145-161.
Cos. 87-84. According to our sources, Cinna was planning to transport his army from Ancona to Liburnia (not Epirus, as in MRR 2.60) when he was killed early in 84 by his mutinous troops (see Badian, Studies 226-228). In the entries in MRR 2.55, 57, and 60, add the phrase Pr. by 90. On the college of two patrician consuls in 86, see MRR 2.30, note 3. T. J. Cadoux suggests that this case, in view of the absence of record of protest at Caesar and Lepidus in 46 (2.293) and at later examples such as Octavian and Messalla in 31 (2.420), indicates, not disregard of mos and ius, but repeal or obsolescence of the old law.
Praetor 45? A son of the famous orator. Catullus 65.2 provides evidence that his cognomen was also Hortalus (Syme, RR 63, note 1** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.264). Possibly quaestor in Asia in 51. If the verb decederet in Cic. Att. 6.3.9 (not 6.6.2, as in MRR 2.573) means leave his province (see Balsdon, CR 51, 1937, 6-10** cf. Badian, Athenaeum 34, 1956, 104ff.) he may have been quaestor in Asia in 51- 50, preceding L. Antonius (Cic. Fam. 2.18). (RS, CP) His praetorship, if he held one, may be a year or two earlier than 45 (Sumner, Phoenbc 25, 1971, 358). Add a query in MRR 2.306. On his cognomen see Shackleton Bailey, Onom.
Cos. 97. L. R. Taylor (VDRR 208) notes that L. Cornelius P. f. ? n. Lentulus Crus (218), the patron of L. Cornelius Balbus of Gades, was also registered in a city tribe and probably in the Palatine. Against the objections of N. Criniti (L?Epigrafe di Asculum 109), who favors a Dolabella, either the cos. or the pr. of 81 (RE nos. 134 or 135), Sumner suggests Lentulus Clodianus (216). Cos. 72 (Orators 124), an adoptive son of the cos. of 97.
Cos. suff. 30. See above, on L. Antistius (13). Shackleton Bailey has shown (Studies 11-13) that the supposed quaestor of 61 never existed (cf MRR 2.214, note 2). To the references given on L. Antistius (13) and Antistius Vetus (47), above, add E. S. Gruen, Athenaeum 49, 1971, 62-67, and LGRR 292. The tribune of the plebs of 56, L. Antistius Vetus, must be clearly distinguished from this C. Antistius Vetus (47),, quaestor pro praetore in Syria in 45-44, legatus of Brutus in 43 (MRR 2.352), commander against the Salassi in 35-34 (MRR 2.407), and Cos. Buff. In 30 (Degrassi, Fast. Cons. 171, 254, 283** see PIR_ 1.146, no. 770).
Pr. 92? and propr. Africa. See MRR 2.33, 41, 49, 45, note 4. For a possible tribe and cognomen, see Wiseman, NM 261, no. 401. At some time in Cicero's youth a P. Sextilius Rufus cheated a friend's daughter of her inheritance, claiming that it was against the Lex Voconia and that he was bound by oath to uphold the law (Cic. Fin. 2.19). The oath indicates that he was a magistrate in office, in this case a praetor. Badian suggests that he was the P. Sextilius who became governor of Africa, was praetor in 92, and propr. in Africa probably through, and certainly after, the Social War (Studies 71-72** JRS 55, 1965, 113).
See MRR 2.44, 55. Not certainly a senator, as no higher office is recorded (Suolahti, Junior Officers 180, 374** rejected by Nicolet, Ordre equestre 585** cf. Wiseman, NM 241, no. 257). He had died before 70 (Cic. Of. 3.73-75** Verr. 2.1.115-166). See, however, Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 167-169 on L. Minuci(us) L. f. Vel., eques in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo, and on the difficulty of identifying the legatus and tr. Mil. under Sulla (RE no. 37, 87 and 86 B.C.) with the rich L. Minucius Basilus of the Cicero references above and Val. Max. 9.4.1. See the stemma of the Minucii in Wiseman, NM 241-242, nos. 257, 258.
A senator in 45, who, with Cn. Domitius Calvinus (43), took the oath on behalf of the Roman people in a treaty with Cnidus (A. Jarde, Mel. Cagnat [1912] 52-58** C. Cichorius, RhM 76, 1927, 327-329). Hanslik in RE would identify him with Cn. Pompeius Q. f. ? n. Rufus (112). Cos. Suff. 31, but the tribe, Collina or Velina, is inconsistent with the Clustumina or Arnensis of the Pompeii Rufi. See Wiseman (CQ 14, 1964, 125), who follows Cichorius in favoring Pomponius Rufus, perhaps brother of the monetalis (26) and son of the tr. Pl. of 90 (3).
His command in Cilicia and later in Syria, in 46, is better described as pro quaestore, or as legatus pro quaestore, since he had been quaestor pro praetore in 48 (MRR 2.276, 288, and in 46, 297** see Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.364). Augur (MRR 2.292) and Praetor (2.306). See ILLRP 439** Wiseman, BIOS 23, 1976, 15-17** Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 358. Proconsul, Africa Vetus, 44-42. See MRR 2.327328, 345, 360- 361. On his acclamation as imperator and his coinage, see Crawford, RRC 1.518-519, no. 509, 42 B.C.** and on his augurate, see also J. R. Fears, Historia 24, 1975, 592-602. See now also E. Rawson, CQ 28, 1978, 188-201.
A senator adlected by Caesar? See Wiseman (CQ 14, 1964, 132-133** NM 281, no. 539), who discusses three possible Licini: one, a barber mentioned in Horace (AP 300-301)** second, a senator, confused with him, who was adlected by Caesar (Comm. Cruq. on Hor. loc. cit.** Schol. on Persius 2.56** and Anth. Pal. [ed. Riese] 268, no. 414, from Varro of Atax)** and third, the notorious freedman of Augustus (cf. Dio 54.21.2- 8). Wiseman suggests that the senator was the husband of Teidia Sex. f., identified as the L. Se]ius L. f. Pom. Licinus (Latomus 22, 1963, 87-90), one of an earlier generation in the family of Seianus from Volsinii.[124x]
Tr. pl. 62, and Aed. ca. 59? (MRR 2.174, 189), and L. (Calpurnius) Bestia (25), Aed. by 57 (MRR 2.201). Although Mènzer distinguishes between these two, they should almost certainly be identified. See R. G. Austin, ed. Cicero Pro Caelio3 (Oxford, 1960), 154-157. The gentilicium of no. 25 is not given, and the aedileship precedes his prosecution in 56. In favor of two persons is Cicero's failure to mention the Catilinarian connections of the aedilicius (Phil. 11.11** 12.20** 13.26)** in favor of one are the dates, recorded political activity, and omission of the praenomen (except in Sallust and Appian). (TJC** RS, CP)
Pr. 81. See MRR 2.76, and 81. Probably proconsul in Hisp. Ult. in 80 (Plut. Sert. 12.3 [#]), where he was defeated by Sertorius (Sall. Hist. 1.108M** Plut. loc. cit.) and called for help from M. Domitius Calvinus (44), proconsul in Hisp. Cit. (Sall. Hist. 1.111M). P. O. Spann, doubting his praetorship and the nature of his command, suggests that he was a legatus pro praetore left in charge (Sertorius 72-73), but to Chr. Konrad he was a praetorian governor (Sertorius 114, cf. 216f.). See now B. Bischoff and H. Bloch, ?Das Wiener Fragment der Historiae des Sallust,? WS, n.s. 13, 1979, 116-129** Wiseman, NM 234, no. 184.[93x]
Cos. 72. Sumner presents a good case for identifying the Cn. Cornelius Cn. f. Pal. in Pompeius Strabo's consilium at Asculum with the consul of 72 (Orators 124-126** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 112-113). The filiation given above assumes that he was an adoptive son of Cn. Cornelius Lentulus (178). Cos. 97. See Sumner and Shackleton Bailey, above, and also Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 108-110** who favors Cn. Cornelius Dolabella (135), Pr. urb. 81. Monetalis: Cn. (Cornelius) (Cn. f.) Lentul(us) (Clodianus). Add in MRR 2.437, and refer to Crawford, RRC 1.356-357, no. 345, 88? B.C.
Cos. 38. Perhaps the Appius (title not attested) in command of the legions that Pompey withdrew from Caesar in 50 (Plut. Pomp. 57.4** cf. Cic. Att. 7.15.3, and 20.1, text uncertain, Shackleton Bailey ad loc.). Mènzer suggests Appius Maior (298), son of C. Claudius Pulcher (303). It is not clear what his position was with M. Antonius in 43 (Cic. Fam. 11.27). (TJC) Perhaps also the Appius whose name is only partially transmitted in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus in 39 in the second, and therefore a praetorian, place in the commission (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 68, on document no. 8).
Cos. 165. Leg., envoy 170-168. See MRR 1.426, no. b. He was sent late in 170 along with C. Popillius Laenas (18), by the Consul, A. Hostilius Mancinus, to visit the Greek cities and strengthen their attachment to the Roman side, and was honored in a decree of Argos. Both envoys returned early in 169 to Hostilius, then proconsul. See P. Charneux, BCH 81, 1957, 181-202** and on the dating, see below on C. Popillius Laenas (18). Cos. 172. Praetor 168. He was honored by Echinus while in command of the fleet in the war with Perseus (Aepig. 1971, no. 450** see MRR 1.428** J. M. Reynolds, JRS 66, 1976, 178).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.450, and Index, 607, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.282, no. 252, 131 B.C. Flamen (Cic. Brut. 135: flamen Albinus). Which flaminate and the dates are uncertain. Sumner (Orators 84) suggests that he was Flamen Martialis, the flaminate favored by the Postumii, in succession to L. Valerius Flaccus (175). Cos. 131, if he died early (ca. 129/128). This would leave a possible interval of some years for the flaminate of Albinus before his own death and the succession of L. Valerius Flaccus (176). Cos. 100, perhaps ca. 109 or 108. But Albinus may have been a Flamen Quirinalis instead.
Procos. in Asia, uncertain date. Delete the cognomen Rufus in MRR 2.481, and Index, 616, and substitute the cognomen Rutilus, which has been read, along with the title Procos., by M. Grant on the coins of a Col(onia) Iu(lia) in Asia Minor (FITA 238-242). He may possibly be identified with M. Sempronius Rutilus (82), a legatus of Caesar in 52 (MRR 2.239), but the title proconsul is against considering him, as Grant suggests, an appointee of Dolabella in 44-43. Syme suggests that he may have been governor of Cilicia after Volcatius Tullus (45-44** see MRR 3.310) in 44 before Dolabella came. (RS, CP)
. . . . . II f., Pr., uncertain date. The name and title in an inscription found at Miletus is reported as follows: ....# | ...# (Milet. 1.2.118, no. 14). M. Segre proposes the reading # and associates him with the M'. Laterensis (see above) who is named on inscriptions of Kalymnos (Ann. Scuola Arch. Atene 22/23, 1952,  158ff., nos. 130A, B, C, D, and E** AEpig. 1940, no. 129), but, if the report in Milet. that the lower bar of the  first # is' clearly preserved is correct, Segre's identification can hardly stand. We would then have another  senator of praetorian rank in the first century, perhaps a Terentius.[225]
Pr. 50.[The name M. Curtius is clearly attested for the quaestor of 61 (Cic. Flacc. 30), and Cicero (P. red. in sen. 21, not[27) shows that the tr. pl. of 57 was named M. Curtius Peducaeanus. The praetor of 50 has the praenomen C. in the Mss of Cic. Fam. 13.59, ,but Mènzer supposes it due to dittography and, with Shackleton Bailey (CLF 1.480), identifies him with the quaestor and the tribune. So also RS, CP** TJC. Moreover, as C. Titius Rufus (37) is addressed in 50 as praetor urbanus (Fam. 13.58) Curtius may reasonably be considered as praetor peregrinus (Shackleton Bailey, above).
Tr. pl. 120, Pr. 115. Badian holds that he was a son of P. Decius Subolo (20), who bore the cognomen himself (Liv. Oxy. Per. 48** Cic. De Or. 2.253 and 277** Val. Max. 6.1.10), and was prominent with Marius in the post-Gracchan period (JRS 46, 1956, 91-96). In his praetorship the consul Aemilius Scaurus had his clothing torn, his curule chair broken, and forbade his judicial activity (Auct. Vir. Ill. 72.6). On his prosecution of Opimius, see Gruen, RPCC 102-105, and on the attack on him, 109-111. On his career and connections, see Badian, op. cit., and comments in Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero 393.
Praetor pro consule. As Sumner has shown, his receipt from Caesar of command over two legions in Asia in 47 is no proof that he had been a praetor in 48 (as in MRR 2.273, cf. 288). He suggests (Phoenix 25, 1971, 251) that the order of offices in ILS 883-ILLRP 402 may be correct and that he was procos. in 47 before he became a praetor, therefore in 46 at the earliest, a date consistent with being a tr. pl. in  53 and a candidate for the plebeian aedileship in 50 (Cic. Fam. 8.4.3), but Degrassi (loc. cit.), following Mommsen (StR 2?.650, note 2), considers praetor pro consule a single office.[60]
Cos. 122. He was probably too young to be a legate at Carthage in 147-146 when with Ti. Gracchus he led in scaling the walls (Plut. TG 4.5), but was probably a junior member of Scipio's staff. Probably not a tribune of the plebs in 142 (see above, on C. Fannius C. f. [7]), but was tr. mil. under Servilianus in Spain in 141 (MRR 1.478, 479, note 1). A tribunate of the plebs in the 130s, though probable, is unattested. On his praetorship in 126-127, see MRR 1.509, note 2. See Sumner, Orators 53-55, 171-174** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 5.400403** Gruen, RPCC 66-67** R. J. Rowland, Jr., Phoenix 23, 1969, 373.
Tr. Pl. 122. Tibiletti has shown that the Lex Rubria to establish a colony at Carthage, being no longer associated in date with the tribunate of Acilius, should probably be placed early in 123 in order to allow time for the physical preparations for the colony and for the trip of C. Gracchus to Africa in 122 (Athenaeum 31, 1950, 1-100, esp. 31-33). See above, on M?. Acilius Glabrio (37). The Lex Rubria mentioned in the treaty between Rome and Astypalaea may be his law, or, as Badian points out, may be the work of an earlier Rubrius (Tibiletti, op. cit., 18, note 2** Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 497).
Cos. 78. On his aedileship, see Amm. Marc. 14:6\.25, and cf. Cic. Off: 2.58** Val. Max. 2.4.6. It was rejected by Mènzer (RE 13.2.2082), but accepted by Sumner (JRS 54, 1964, 45, note 48** Orators 116** cf. Badian, Studies 217-219). A date ca. 84 is based on a calculation from the date of his consulship. Consul 78 and Censor 65. See ILLRP 369** cf. also G. Molisani, Lucius Cornelius Quinti Catuli Architectus, RAL 26, 1971, 41-49-AEpig. 1971, no. 61. Refer also to Plut. Cat. Min. 16.4-6 on the dispute between the younger Cato as quaestor and Catulus before he abdicated his censorship.
Aed. pl. See MRR 1.340, and 342, note 1** cf. 286, 289, note 4. Degrassi (ILLRP 357) rejects the identification of this ledile with the tr. Pl. of 209 in favor of some otherwise unknown ledile of the age of Sulla, the period of the monument. He believes the person and the family were too unimportant to justify rebuilding the monument in a later period. C. (Publicius) Mall(eolus) (18). Monetalis. In MRR 2.450, and Index, 609, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.333- 336, no. 335, 96 B.C.? (with A. Albinus S. f. and L. Metel(lus)). Probably the quaestor with Cn. Dolabella in Cilicia in 80.
father of C. Claudius P. f. Nero (247). Pr. 81 and Procos. in Asia in 80. P. Conole, in connection with his discussion of the suppression of the revolt of Fregellae by L. Opimius in 125, suggests that this man was the commander P. Claudius who is reported in Valerius Maximus (6.5.1) as subduing ductu atque auspiciis suis the revolt of the Camerini (undated, and were they Amerini or Arretini?) and treating them so generously (Antichthon 15, 1981, 129-140). The praenomen P., infrequent among Claudii Nerones, gives some support to the suggestion. There is no other mention of him and his command.
Father and son. The father, an officer (#) under M. Antonius at Actium, was saved by the appeal of his son, who had been an officer there under Octavian (#, App. BC 4.42). As Appian means had commanded rather than had been a praetor in this context, the praetor of uncertain date, MRR 2.463, and Index, should be deleted. Mommsen suggests that the father may have been the M. Metellus who gave a gladiatorial show in 60 (Att. 2.1.1) and the son possibly Caecilius M. f. Metellus, pr. urb., procos. Sardiniae, named in CIL 10.7581 (EE 3.14). (TJC)[35x]
Cos. 106. Leg., lieut. 129. Mistakenly listed as a tr. mil. in MRR 1.505. Named in an inscription of Bargylia as serving under M'. Aquillius in Asia in 129 (Holleaux, REA 21, 1919, 7-16** C. P. Jones, Chiron 4, 1974, 192, note 49). His title is given as # in an inscription of Maionia in Lydia (P. Herrmann, Denkschr. Akad. Wien, p.-h. Kl. 80, 1962, 5, no. 2** J. and L. Robert, Bull. Epig. 1963, 165, no. 220). Cos. 106. G. Tibiletti holds that a fragment of his Lex iudiciaria may be preserved in the Fragmentum Tarentinum (Athenaeum 31, 1953, 1-100, esp. 38-57, 73-75).
Pr., procos., uncertain date. Named in an inscription of Tenos as proconsul (IG 12.5.924, #), he is more likely to have been a governor of Macedonia than of Asia. If he was the L. Quinctius who was tr. pl. in 74, and pr. in 69 or 68 (RE no. 12** MRR 2.103, 138), he could have been governor of Macedonia in 68 or 67 (but see on Rubrius, MRR 2.138, 147, and 150, note 12** and above, on *L. Aurelius). Cicero in 66 implies that he had died (Cluent. 110-113). But the inscription of Tenos may be dated as late as Augustus. See Syme, Historia 4, 1955, 67-68** Wiseman, NM 255, no. 352.
Leg., envoy 82. After Mithridates' complaints to Sulla and the Senate about Murena's incursions (App. Mith. 65) C. was sent to Murena with a public message not to molest the king. See D. G. Glew, Chiron  11, 1981, 115-117. Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 123, suggests that he was either M. Calidius (3). Monetalis,  formerly dated to 106, but now by Crawford to 117 or 116, or (more probably) Q. Calidius (5), praetor in 79. A. Keaveney suggests Q. Calidius (5). Pr. 79, as the most probable identification (Klio 65, 1983, 185-186** cf. MRR 2.83, 86), but considers M. Calidius (4). Pr. 57, as possible.
Sent by Sulla with forces to aid Ascalis of Tingi in 81-80 and met his death (Plut. Sert 9.4-5). See Plut. Crass. 4.3, on Crassus? protector in southern Spain in 85, Vibius Paciacus or Pacciaecus: Mèznzer, noting the uncertainty in the tradition of the name, suggests that they may be the same. See RE, s. v. Paciaecus** MRR 2.313, on L. Vibius Paciaecus** Wiseman, NM 248, no. 300. See also A. J. N. Wilson, Emigration from Italy 30f.** B. Scardigli, Athenaeum 49, 1971, 244-250** P. 0. Spann, Sertorius 66-69, who thinks P. was sent by the governor of Hisp. Ult.** C. F. Konrad, Sertorius 37-38.
Cos. 81. Procos. in Macedonia. See MRR 2.74, 80, 84, 86, 89. An inscription of Thasos (Dunant and Pouilloux, Etudes Thas. 5.2, no. 175), which follows immediately after an SC and letter of Sulla (no. 174) confirming rights and privileges he has granted, identifies the proconsul named in it as the consul of 81 and proconsul of Macedonia from 80 to 77, and supplies the filiation missing in Fast. Cap. See Badian, PBSR 33, 1965, 48-51, with a stemma of the family. After his return and triumph he was prosecuted unsuccessfully by Julius Caesar (MRR 2.89).
Q. urb. 44. Syme (CPh 50, 1955, 134) identifies nos. 5 and 52, while accepting the possibility of identifying all three. To identify nos. 5 and 51 is reasonable since minor pontifices were once termed scribae pontificii (Liv. 22.57.3). Cadoux objects to identifying nos. 5 and 52 because the word fuit in Cic. Off. 2.29, written in 44, is against a quaestorship in that year, but Sumner notes that, since Cicero was writing in October of 44 and in November (Att. 15.13a.2** 16.11.4), he could have held the office and died before autumn (Phoenix 25, 1971, 368). See MRR 2.135 and 325.
Officer under Cassius at Rhodes in 42, perhaps a praetor of uncertain date (MRR 2.465). The praenomen L. does appear in the record of the gens Quinctilia. The officer whom Cassius left at Rhodes (2.368) should be listed as L. Varus (Syme, Historia 5, 1956, 208-RP 1.319). The man who died at Philippi in the insignia of office (yell. 2.71.2) was a Quinctilius Varus, and may be identified with Sex. Quinctilius Varus (17). Quaestor 49 (MRR 2.259). It is uncertain if he attained the praetorship, but at least the plural is used of his honores by 42 (Veil. 2.71.2). (RS, CP)
Pr. 80?, Procos. 79? See MRR 2.79, 84, 85, note 4. His praetorship should almost certainly be redated to 81 and his proconsulate in Hisp. Cit. to 80 (Salt. Hist 1.111M), with his death in battle against Hirtuleius, Sertorius' quaestor (Plut. Sert. 12.4, and other sources listed in MRR). On the verso of the Vienna fragment of Sallust's Histories, see Bischoff-Bloch, WS, n.s. 13, 1979, 116-129. Note that several of the too many names listed for the praetors of 81 (MRR 2.76) have been placed only at the latest legal date. Some must have held the office in previous years.
Quaestor in Spain 81. In MRR 2.77, refer to Sall. Hist. 3.83M (not 63M), and to Crawford, RRC 1.381, no. 366, 82-81 B.C. See Wiseman, NM 230, no. 168. C. F. Konrad notes that since proscription listings ended on June 1, 81, the proscription of Fabius (Sall. loc. cit.) must have occurred, not in 77 in connection with Lepidus, but while he was still quaestor under Annius in Spain. He suggests that this was the reason why he went over to Sertorius** see Senator ex proscriptis: A Note on L. Fabius Hispaniensis and Sertorius' Return from Africa, AJPh forthcoming.
Cos. 149. Pr. procos. in Spain 155 or 154. See MRR 1.448, 451, note 1. As Appian at Ib. 56 returns to the farther province after relating events in the nearer one up to 150, Wilsdorf had a reasonable basis for assigning Ulterior to Manilius in 155 and Calpurnius Piso in 154 (MRR 1.450), but during the wars armies and commanders were often engaged in either province at need, so Simon?s view (Kriege 13-14) that Manilius was governor of Citerior and Piso of Ulterior, both in 154, is also acceptable. See also Astin, Scipio Aemilianus 37, note 2** Sumner, Orators 62.
Cos. 53. AS the Valerii Messallae who were consules suffecti, one in 32 (255) and the other, Corvinus, in 31 (261) were hardly senior enough to take first place in the senatorial committee listed in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus (in 39, not 35, as in MRR 2.406** Sherk, RDGE 170ff.** see J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 54-91, esp. 67-68), Badian's suggestion (reported by Reynolds, ibid. 67) that the Messalla who is placed first was the consul of 53 becomes very attractive. If it is correct, the consul's filiation is M. f. and his tribe is Lem.
Cos. 30. He had served under Sextus Pompey and had probably been restored after the pact of Misenum (cf. Vell. 2.77.3** App. BC 5.72** Dio 48.36.4). (TJC) Augur. See MRR 2.426. Positive identification of M. Licinius Crassus Frugi (59). Cos. 14, in an inscription of Lepcis Magna, as an augur, lessens the probability that the notice of an augurate quoted at MRR 2.426 is correctly referred to his father, the consul of 30 (see Goodchild, PBSR 18, 1950, 72-77** J. M. Reynolds and J. B. Ward Perkins, The Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania 97, no. 319).[118x]
Pr. by 91. See MRR 2.30. Livy (Per. 72) notes his escape from capture by the Lucanians. Leg., lieut. 90, 89. See MRR 2.30, 37. In MRR 2.30, 32, note 18, 37, and 39, note 27, cf. H. B. Mattingly, Athenaeum 53, 1975, 263-266, who holds that the officer whose name is preserved in the list of Cn. Pompeius Strabo's consilium at Asculum as . . . ]cius C. f. Ani. Was not a Galba, as Cichorius held (RS 137- 139), but was a plebeian, perhaps a relative of the moneyer C. Sulpici(us) C. f. (9). Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 96-98, agrees with Cichorius.[201x]
A senator in 66, who was condemned in that year under the Lex Calpurnia de ambitu of 67, and deprived of his rank of senator (Cic. Sull. 6** cf. 67). Sallust incorrectly terms him a senator when, with the eques C. Cornelius, he plotted to murder Cicero at the morning salutatio (Cat. 28.1** cf. 17.3), but he may rightly be considered one of the duo equites Romani whom Cicero mentions in Cat. 19. See J. Linderski, Historia 12, 1963, 511-512. Cf. Plut. Cic. 16.1 and App. BC 2.3, who give other names, the former, Marcius and Cethegus, and the latter, Lentulus and Cethegus.
Cos. 200, Pr. 202. Termed Praetor iterum in CIL 1_.2.610-ILLRP 75. See[30x] MRR 1.320, and 322, note 2. Against Mommsen's view that the word iterum describes prorogation into 201 (StR 3.1093), J. Jahn suggests that he had been elected before 202 but had not been kept in Livy's record because of some failure to take office (vitio creates?** Chiron 2, 1972, 171-174). R. Develin notes examples in the period when a propraetor is called praetor, and although there is no mention of prorogation holds Mommsen's suggestion possible (Historia 27, 1978, 231).
Pr. before 75. Badian (Historia 12, 1963, 135-136) makes the attractive suggestion that this name, spelled # in SIG? 747, stands, not for M. Cassius M. f. Pompt. as in MRR 2.114, but for M. Caesius (#) (9), praetor in 75 (MRR 2.96), along with C. Licinius Sacerdos (154), who is with him in the inscription. See J. M. Cody, who defends the reading M. Cas(s)ius M. f. Pompt., using an inscription on the Augustan gem, M. Cas. M. f. Longini, and suggests that Pomptina was the tribe of the Cassii Longini (CPh 64, 1969, 177-178** cf. L. R. Taylor, VDRR 279).[44x]
Tr. pl. 87 or 86. Sea Schol. Bern. on Lucan 2.125 (Usener), Marius Caelium tribunum  plebi sillanum de Tarpeio saxo praecipitavit. His identity remains uncertain, but he may be the tribune .whom  the younger Marius, according to Dio 30-35, fr. 102, 12, threw from the Capitol at the time of the New Year sacrifice in 86. If the Marius in question was Gratidianus, date and occasion for the death of Caelius become less certain. See below, on Marius (42). I wish to thank Elizabeth Rawson for drawing these passages on Caelius and Marius Gratidianus to my attention.
Quaestor under Sertorius, 79, and proq. ?8 to 77 or 76? See MRR 2.80, 87, and 94. If the battles at Lauro in which he and his troops took part and defeated Pompey's legate, D. Laelius, took place in 77, the notice in MRR 2.94 should be placed under 77, Promagistrates (see below, on D. Laelius no. 5** Sall. Hist. 2.31M, from Schol. Bob. on Cic. Flacc. 14, p. 98St). It was then in the winter of 77/76 that Sertorius placed him in command against Metellus in Baetica (Liv. 91, fr. 22W). Or has the scholiast confused him with Herennius? See below, on Q. Hirtuleius (4).
Pr. 50 or 49. Monetalis, Xvvir s. f. His coins, dated to 65 by Sydenham (see MRR 2.445) and Crawford (RRC 1.439, no. 411), wrongly to 69 in MRR 2.135, bear the symbols of the Quindecimvirate, and may refer to his own priesthood. Cicero (Sulla 24) implies that he was a candidate for some office in 62 against considerable rivalry (Sumner, Orators 139-140). Pr. 5O or 49. MRR 2.257. Because Cicero omits the title praetor in Att. 8.1113, Shackleton Bailey doubts that he is correctly called praetor in 49 by Caesar in BC 1.24.2-3 (CLA 4.342f.).
Cos. 508. E. Meyer (Brasmus 6, 1953, nos. 13-14, col. 480) notes that for 508 Tribunes of the Soldiers is an incorrect title, and that citation of Dion. Hal., who dates these persons and events to 507, creates inconsistencies, since Lucretius as a result appears as a consul in some sources and as an officer in others in the same year, and the only evidence for the legates T. Herminius and Sp. Larcius (Flavus?) is dated by the sources to 507. See R. M. Ogilvie, Comm. Liu 1-5 253, on the confusion of sources and of chronology in this year.
Quaestor, and praefectus Capuam Cumas. See MRR 2.476 and 483. Add a reference to ILLRP 441, and note Degrassi's comment that these prefects lost their power with the refounding of Capua in 59, and were abolished before 13 (cf. Mommsen, StR 2?.609-610). In MRR 2.476, he is listed as a quaestor before 90, but Badian (Dial. Archeol. 4-5, no. 2-3, 1970-71, 376, note 14) dates him some time after the Social War, and adds must surely be the son or the grandson of the consul of 93 (cf. Historia 12, 1963, 134). See also L. R. Taylor, VDRR 220.
Pr. 49. Quaestor in Macedonia ca. 62? Shackleton Bailey, noting that in Fam. 13.78 Cicero recommends to Allienus the interests of a Greek, Demetrias of Sicyon, suggests that this points to a quaestorship in Macedonia ca. 62 before he became a legatus with Q. Cicero in Asia in 61 (CLF 2.439). Praetor 49. In MRR 2.257, refer also to CIL 1_.2.1237-ILLRP 396-ILS 7850. Proconsul Sicily, 48-46. See MRR 2.275, 288, 296. Crawford dates his coinage there to 47 (RRC 1.471, no. 459), a dating possible until the end of 47, since the legend is C. Caesar Imp. Cos. Iter.[14x]
As he was not described specifically as a legatus when he was serving under Caesar in 53-51 (MRR 2.231, 239, 244), and there is no specific record of him from 51 until 49, when he is called legatus (MRR 2.268** cf. 253), Sumner suggests that he may have been quaestor in 55 or 54, or else in 50 (Phoenix 25, 1971, 359). He is definitely attested as praetor in 45 (Dio 43.45.5), and as one of Caesar?s assassins. See below, on M. Satrius (1), and on another L. Minucius Basilus (Cic. 0,f: 3.143** Phil. 2.107). See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 53-54, and Onom. **
Tr. pl. 68. See ILLRP 465a, and MRR 2.139. Firmly supported as tribune in 68 by Sumner (Orators 136), and by Syme (JRS 53, 1963, 55-56-RP 2.557-565), who suggests that he was the consul of 66, L. Volcatius Tullus (8). Tullus had been defeated for the aedileship (Cic. Planc. 51), had probably been praetor several years before (69 in MRR 2.132 is the latest possible date), and may have wished to keep himself prominent by seeking the tribunate at an irregular time (Syme loc. cit.). Probably not a novas homo (Cic. Leg. Agr. 2.3** Wiseman, NM 276-277, no. 506).
Quaestor 120. In MRR 1.524, delete the praenomen P. The more recent dating of the SC de agro Pergameno to 129 removes the evidence for the praenomen which Cichorius suggested (RS 116-125)** see now Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73** cf. MRR 2.23, where the completion of the name P. Al[..., and others in the list is quite uncertain** cf. also 2.24, note 10. Mention of the tabulae (Cic. De Or. 2.281) confirms that Albius was Scaevola's quaestor in Asia in 120, whatever the evidence they provided the unsuccessful prosecutor Albucius in his trial (see Gruen, RPCC 115-116).
Tr. mil. c. p. 402. Mènzer, quoted by Gundel in RE, holds that his trial and fine by the tribunes of the plebs in 401 (see MRR 1.84** Ogilvie, Comm. Liv 644, 649) practically ended the importance of the patrician line, although there are two later appearances of patrician Verginii, one in 389 (MRR 1.96) and the other perhaps in 373 (MRR 1.110, note 1). This would make the identification of no. 15 with the Tr. Mil. c. p. of 389 less probable (see MRR 1.96 and 98, note 3). No numeral suggesting iteration is preserved.
Quaestor pro praetore. He was sent in 75, or more[68x] probably in 74, to Cyrene as quaestor pro praetore, or perhaps, like Cato to Cyprus in 58, as pro quaestore pro praetore to settle disturbed conditions in Cyrene (MRR 2.103** Oost, CPh 58, 1963, 11-25** Badian, JRS 55, 1965, 119-126** cf. J. M. Reynolds, JRS 52, 1962, 101). On his lineage, Sumner, Orators 92-93, 133, 141-143, with stemma, shows that the suggestion of Willems and Mènzer (RE no. 238) identifying him with Lentulus Spinther (238). Cos. 57, is impossible.
B. W. Frier suggests that the father of the consul of the same name in 34 may have been praetor urbanus in 80, and as such may have built the Puteal Libonis (or Scribonianum) in connection with the building of a praetor's tribunal in the southeastern part of the Forum (TAPhA 113, 1983, 221-241, esp. 223). Cf. MRR 2.479 and 481** ILS 5526, 5528** ILLRP 411, 567, 568. On the Puteal, see also L. Richardson, MDAI(R) 80, 1973, 219-233, esp. 229-231** E. Nash, Pictorial Dictionary of Ancient Rome 2.259-261** Crawford, RRC 1.441-442, no. 416, 62 B.C.
Shackleton Bailey has shown that these two entries (MRR 2.580, Index) describe the career of one person, a Iunius Brutus Damasippus who was adopted by a P. Licinius Crassus. Delete the cognomen Dives. See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 46-47** AJAH 1, 1976, 162-163. On his coinage when he was legatus pro praetore in Africa in 47-46 (MRR 2.301, and Index, 580), see now Crawford, RRC 1.472, no. 460, inscribed P. CRASSVS IVN. LEG. PROM He may have been a praetor in 51 (Cic. Att. 5.3.2: Edictum P. Licini** cf. Willems, Senat 1.515, no. 303).
Cos. 166. The connection with Spain implied in his appointment in 171 to the commission on misgovernment there (Liv. 43.2.5, 7** MRR 1.419) may well have been made after 191, the date suggested by Mènzer** cf. MRR 1.355. See Sumner, Orators 37-38, who also suggests that he was, like his fellow envoy, L. Aurelius Cotta, a military tribune under Aemilius Paullus in Liguria in 182-181 (Liv. 42.27.6, and 28.8) and would change the praenomen L. in that passage to C. It would be the only example of L. among the patrician Sulpicii.
Cos. 78. ProCOs. 77. His province included both Transalpine and Cisalpine Gaul, since M. Iunius Brutus (52) was his legatus (Badian, Mel. Piganiol, 910** cf. MRR 2.91). Criniti dates his death in Sardinia in summer 77 (MIL 30, 4, 1969, 445). For a detailed study of Lepidus' career, see N. Criniti in MIL 30, 4, 1969, 319-459. On his quaestorship, probably ca. 91, see Badian, Klio 66, 1984, 300-301. Procos. or propr. in Sicily 80. In MRR 2.80, refer also to Cic. Verr. 2.2.8, and Shackleton Bailey, HSPh 83, 1979, 245-246.
A consular who was proscribed and killed in 43 (App. BC 4.28). The consular lists provide no clue to his identity since L. Cassius Longinus, Cos. 73, did not bear the cognomen Varus which Willems ascribed to him (Senat 1.433), and Cicero implies in Phil. 2.13-14 that only two consulars senior to himself, L. Cotta and L. Caesar, were still alive in the autumn of 44. (TJC) He was perhaps one of the ex-praetors to whom Caesar granted consularia ornamenta (Suet. Iul. 76.3** cf. Dio 43.47.5). See Syme, Historia 5, 1956, 208RP 1.319.
Cos. 33. A. new fragment of the decree on the calendar of Asia (OGIS 458) found by Frend in Apameia shows that the Volcacius Tullus of line 42 was the consul of 33, not his homonymous nephew, the friend of Propertius (A. H. M. Jones, CR 4, 1955, 244** cf. L. Robert, Bull. Epig.  1958, no. 466). Note that he was proconsul in Asia in 28-27 or 27-26. See Ehrenberg-Jones, no. 98** SEG 15, no. 454** and on the name, Syme, JRS 39, 1949, 18. See also Syme, JRS 45, 1955, 159?RP 1.267** K. M. T. Atkinson, Historia 7, 1958, 312-314.
Although he was a juror in the trial of Cluentius (Cic. Cluent. 198), and was probably the Pontifex Minor listed in Macrob. Sat. 3.13.11, and although he is listed after a senator in Cicero, it is less certain that he was a senator than Gundel (RE) and Nicolet (L'ordre equestre 1083, no. 401) believe. He may have been placed last for rhetorical effect (Shackleton Bailey, Onom.). As the Pontifex Minor does not appear in 57 (Cic. Har. Resp. 12** MRR 2.206), he cannot be both the Pont. Min. and the friend of M. Antonius in 43 (Cic. Phil. 13.3).
Cos. 132. Praetor in Sicily? 135? His praetorship in Sicily (MRR 1.489 and 483, note 1) depends on whether or not he is the missing subject of the acephalous inscription of Polla (CIL 1_.638-ILS 23-ILLRP 454). See above, on T. Annius Rufus (78). Cos. 128, and on Ap. Claudius Pulcher (295). Cos. 143. He is not named in Florus? list (2.7.7) of praetors in Sicily during the revolt, as implied wrongly in MRR 1.483, note 1. On the inscription of Polla, see also A. E. Gordon, Latin Epigraphy, no. 12, pp. 87-89.
Cos. 101. Leg., amb. 90, 89, 88. The embassy of M'. Aquillius, MalliusMaltinus, and Mancinus, which was sent with instructions to restore Nicomedes of Bithynia and Ariobarzanes of Cappadocia to their thrones (see MRR 2.35-36), went in 90 and continued into 89 and 88 (see Greenidge and Clay, Sources, 2nd ed. by E. W. Gray, 149-150** cf. Badian, AJAH 1, 1976, 109 and 122, note 17). On the capture of Aquillius at Mitylene (MRR 2.43), refer also to Diod. 37.27.1. In Gran. Lic. 35, 75 (Criniti) his title is legatus, and, strangely, it is reported that years after he was killed, Sulla demanded his return from Mithridates.
Tr. Pl. ? 59, Pr. 58. The preparations mentioned in Cic. Att. 2.2.3 (December 60) envisage a trial with iudices. So Niccolini?s conjecture of a tribunate is not satisfactory (MRR 2.193, note 5). If Nigidius were perhaps aedile of the plebs in 60, iudex quaestionis in 59, and praetor in 58 (see the conjecture of Kroll, not Mènzer, in RE) it would be a normal series of offices and dates. (TJC) But the praetorship in 58 is the only well-attested office (Badian, JRS 49, 1959, 83). Add a reference to Dio 45.1 in MRR 2.193, note 5.
Pr. -. A senator of Cicero?s generation who probably attained the praetorship, since Cicero considered him a possibility for the consulship (Brut. 245). As his inscription at Delos (MRR 2.493) is a twin of the one honoring the proquaestor M?. Lepidus (62). Cos. 66 (I. De Delos 4.1.1659), even with the exact space for the word #, he was either a quaestor by 76 or a proquaestor under Sulla from 84- 81. See Gruen, LGRR 164, note 2** Sumner, Orators 130-131. Enter him in MRR 2.464, Praetors of uncertain date.[136x]
Cos. 298. See MRR 1.174. According to A. La Regina the Lucanians he subdued were a northern group who inhabited the Sangro valley and were later forgotten (Dial. di ArcheoL 2, 1968, 173-190). On Barbatus (ILLRP 309) and the other inscriptions from the Tomb of the Scipios with the names of Scipios who were magistrates, and members of their families, see ILLRP nos. 310-317. See also A. La Regina, above** F. Zevi, Stud. Misc. 15, 1969-70, 69ff.** F. Coarelli, Dial. di Archeol. 6, 1972, 36-106.[71]
Pr. by 45. Clark restored his name as a praetor in the place of the corrupt reading M. Antonius in Cic. Phil. 3.26, but Sumner has shown that the name needed is that of C. Calvisius C. f. Sabinus (13). Cos. 39 (Phoenix 25, 1971, 265-266, 364). Delete the name of Gallius from the list of praetors in MRR 2.321. He may be identified with the M. Gallius Q. f. who was an officer under Caesar in August 47, bringing troops to Sicily (Cic. Att. 11.20.2) and so had held the praetorship by 45 (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 366-367, note 55).
Cos. 151. Xvir s. f. The successor to L. Cornelius Lentulus in 173 as Xvir s. f., listed in MRR 1.410 as L. Postumius Albinus Luscus (46). Cos. 180, may very well have been his son, Cos. 151 (Sumner, Orators 48** cf. 42). Aed. cur. 159? Mènzer, RE 22.1.903, offers a conjecture that this Postumius was curule aedile in 159. Leg., amb. 146-145. See MRR 1.467. Mènzer suggests that the honors paid to him at Olympia (I. Olymp. 322) and at Delphi (SEG 1.152) indicate that he was senior member of the embassy.
Prefect under Mark Antony at Cos, 32-31. He sacrilegiously cut down much of the sacred  grove of Aesculapius at Cos in order to get timber for the fleet (Val. Max. 1.1.19** Lactant. Div. Inst. 2.7, both with the title praefectus). Dio (51.8.2) has the praenomen P., but D. TVR is the inscription on the coins he issued under M. ANTONIVS. AVGVR IMP. about 31 (Grueber, CRRBM 2.531** Sydenham, CRR lxix, 195, 1211- 1211a** and now Crawford, RRC 1.542, no. 545, 31 B.C.). (RS, CP) See also Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 123- 124-RP 2.602-603.
Pr. 53, and Procos. Africa 52. See MRR 2.228, 237. Under the decree of the Senate in 53 which prohibited the holding of a province ex praetura or ex consulatu (Dio 40.46.2), Varus must have been praetor by 54 and proconsul in Africa in 53, not 53 and 52, resp. See Caes. BC 1.31.2. Since C. Considius Longus (11) was governor of Africa after him in 52 and 51, he was probably praetor in 55 and governor of Africa already in 54. See Cic. Lig. 3-6** MRR 2.260** Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 268, note 41** and Shackleton Bailey, Onom.
Pr. 94. Aedile ca. 97 (Cic. Planc. 19** see Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 158- 159-RP 2.607-608). Pr. 94. In MRR 2.12, refer also to Cic. Planc. 19. Procos. Macedonia, 93-87. His imperium may well have been pro consule, like that of his colleague Gellius Publicola in Asia in 93-92 (MRR 2.15). On his full name and his career, with a stemma of the family, see Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 156-166, esp. 158- 159-RP 2.605-616** Wiseman, NM 260, no. 388** and, explaining his long term in Macedonia, Badian, Studies 73-74.
Cos. 108. Sumner dates his praetorship and command in Hisp. Ult. from 111 into 109 (Orators 72), when he was succeeded by Q. Servilius Caepio. Cf. MRR 1.540, 544. Cos. 108. His name is used without that of his colleague in an inscription of the Campanian magistri (A. de Franciscis, Epigraphica 12, 1950, 126-130) to mark the date, which may therefore fall within the period between the condemnation of Hortensius and the election of M. Aurelius Scaurus (215) as Cos. Buff. in 108. See MRR 1.548.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.436, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.413, no. 403, 70 B.C., and add a reference to RE no. 18, the Pontifex. So, too, in the Index, 2.550. Note also the name P. Mucius Scaevola, Pont., on one side of a broken inscription of Tarraco, perhaps later than 49, since the name of Pompeius Magnus on the other side is inscribed with top and bottom reversed: Geza Alfåldy, Die råmische Inschriften von Tarraco ? Aepig. 1957, no. 310. Perhaps RE no. 18 or a son. See below on Cn. Pompeius Magnus (31).
Rex sacrorum. Note Shackleton Bailey's suggestion (Studies 25-26), made because the praenomen Lucius was banned among the patrician Claudii (Suet. Tib. 1.2), that the gentilicium of the rex sacrorum of 57 (Har. Resp. 12** but cf. Dom. 127 a gentili tuo) should possibly be emended to L. Cloulius, perhaps a descendant of P. Cloelius Siculus, who was appointed rex sacrorum in 180. But the rex is addressed as a gentilis of Clodius in Dom. 127. Shackleton Bailey, Onom., has withdrawn his suggestion and accepts L. Claudius.
Quaestor under Metellus Pius in Hisp. Ult. in 74? (see MRR 2.103), but in 75 if the return of Metellus Pius to Hisp. Ult. is correctly placed above in the autumn of 75 (see Cn. Pompeius Magnus, RE no. 31) (Sall. Hist. 2.70M, from Macrob. Sat. 3.13.6-9, with the spelling Urbinus). He is conjecturally identified with the Urbinus who was proscribed and saved by a slave who took his place (Macrob. Sat. 1.11.16)** called Urbinius Panapio in Val. Max. (6.8.6** cf. Dio 47.10.2). (TJC) See Wiseman, NM 268, no. 453.
Senator, witness to an SC in 44. The nomen given as # in Josephus (AJ 14.220) was surely Quinctius. The tribe is given as # or #** read Pol. or Pub. (TJC) Badian would identify him with the # (ca. 16 letters) # in the SC de Panamareis (Gnomon 33, 1961, 496** Historia 12, 1963, 137-138** accepted by Sherk, RDGE no. 127, p. 162, taking Plancinus as a more probable equivalent for the Greek cognomen than Palicanus). Cf. M. Lollius Palikanus (20), above. See Wiseman, NM 237, no. 231.
He is named as praetor (#) or praetorian governor on a statue ,base found at Calymnos along with a base bearing the name of P. Servilius P. f. proconsul #) (AEpig. 1940, no. 129** Ann. d. Scuola Arch. di Atene 22/23, 1952, 158ff., nos. 130, A, C, D, E, above the name of Servilius in D). The date remains uncertain, but the praenomen distinguishes him from M. the praetor of 51. (RS, MS-RP 1.282) Crawford, RRC 1.372, no. 358, suggests that he may be the moneyer Laterensis (see below).
He is named in an unpublished inscription of Cos (noted in RE, above) as the man who cast the first vote in the assembly for measures favored by Mark Antony (cf. Fonteius, no. 20, above). Probably a senator, but the case of A. Gabinius Capito (CIL 1_.2500** C. Nicolet et al., Insula sacra 53-56) shows that this does not prove it. He was important enough to be sent in 32 to urge Antony to make peace with Octavian (Plut. Ant. 59). (RS, MS-RP 1.282** LRT) See Wiseman, NM 233, no. 195.
Pr.? and Propr. Asia, ca. 90. See MRR 2.20, 27. Cicero mentions duo Balbi in De Or. 3.78, and names L. Lucilius Balbus (19) in Brut. 154, along with C. Aquillius Gallus (23), and the two together in Quinct. 53-54. *L. Lucilius Balbus (19) may be the L. Lucilius L. f. named above. Sumner, on the basis of I. Priene 111, lines 135-148, suggests 90 as the date for his term as governor of Asia, after the elder Iulius Caesar (130) and into 89 and the arrival of C. Cassius (10) (GRBS 19, 1978, 149-150)
Quaestor 41. The cognomen used in MRR 2.372 and 462, and the Index, 537, Philippus, is mistaken. The name of the quaestor of M. Antonius in 41 can be recovered from Cic. Phil. 13.3, Barbatii Polliones (removing the comma from Clark's edition), and his praenomen from the coins (see now Crawford, RRC 1.525, no. 517, 41 B.C.). He may therefore be M. Barbatius Pollio, curule aedile of uncertain date, who is named in ILS 9261** cf. PIR_ 1.352, no. 50. (RS, MS-RP 1.276-277** TJC) See Wiseman, NM 217, no. 64.
Tr. Pl. 90. See MRR 2.26, 31, note 9. In view of the many historical and legal difficulties involved in accepting a trial of Cn. Pompeius Strabo lege Varia de maiestate, cum primum senatores cum equitibus Romanis lege Plotia iudicarent (Cicero Corn., quoted in Ascon. 79C), Badian advocates acceptance of Pighius? emendation Pomponium (Historia 18, 1969, 465-475** cf. in Greenidge and Clay_, E. W. Gray?s note: ?perhaps Cn. Pomponius, tr. Pl., 90 B.C.?). See also E. Gabba, ANRW 1.1, 1972, 791, note 161.[166]
Pr. Hisp. Cit. 145 or 144. See MRR 1.466 on Claudius Unimanus, 1.469 on Nigidius and also on Laelius. These three governors of Hisp. Cit., not mentioned by Appian, must be dated before Metellus Macedonicus, Cos. 143** while the notice in Auct. Vir. Ill. 76 places Nigidius after Claudius. Simon (Kriege 77- 79) would place Nigidius after Laelius, Pr. in 145, but as the latter was active in Rome for some time in his praetorship (MRR 1.469) before going to Spain, I am inclined to list him next after Nigidius.
Cos. 190. Pr. Sicily 193. Badian, noting the uncertain reading of the cognomen in ILS 864 (Schiziam Or Fiizivm) and the early doubling of the consonant in caussa, suggests that the inscription may honor, not a Scipio, but L. Cornelius Sisenna (374). Pr. 78 and possibly procos. in Sicily in 77 (MRR 2.86, 90) (Gnomon 39, 1967, 94, note 1). See Degrassi, ILLRP 320, and Acta 5th Internat. Cong. Gr. and Lat. Epig. 169-170** and also Balsdon, Historia 21, 1972, 224-234.
Aed. pl. 86, pr. 80. In MRR 2.63, and Index, 565, transfer the notices of L. Fan(nius) and L. Crit(onius), aediles of the plebs, from 83 to 86 (to MRR 2.54), and refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.367, no. 151. The date in 86 makes uncertain the date of his subsequent service as iudex quaestionis (MRR 2.76) when he presided over the quaestio de sicariis et veneficis (Cic. Rosc. Amer. 11), perhaps as early as 85, before presiding over it again as praetor in 80. See T. E. Kinsey, Mnemosyne 20, 1967, 61-67.
Tr. pl. 68. Named in a list of tribunes dating in some year between 72 and 68 and most[61] probably in 68 (MRR 2.138, 141, note 8** ILS 5800, with 38** ILLRP 465a** and Syme, JRS 53, 1963, 58?RP 2, 563** Sumner, Orators 125-127). He should be identified with the Cn. Lentulus who was tribune in one year and legatus in the next (Cic. Leg. Man. 58), and, being a plebeian Lentulus, descended from the Claudii Marcelli, may be Cn. Cornelius P. f. - n. Lentulus Marcellinus (228). Cos. 56 (Sumner, loc. cit.).
An inscription found in Ephesus on a statue base honors a Q. Publicius Q. f.,[175] proquaestore propraetore (D. Knibbe and B. Iplikcioglu, JOEAI 53, 1981-82 [1983], 141, no. 147), who may perhaps be identified with Q. Publicius, praetor 67 (see above), and represents him at an earlier stage in his career. The editors suggest that he served in Asia with Lucullus, and refer, in spite of the interval of several years, to the statue mentioned in Cic. QF 1.2.14 as decreed but not yet authorized.
Aed. Cur. 79. See above, on L. Licinius Lucullus (104). Cos. 73. On the iudicium mentioned in MRR 2.93, see now B. W. Frier, TAPhA 113, 1983, 232-234. Procos. Macedonia and Thrace 72-71. He is termed imperator in a Greek inscription of Mesembria (Detchev, Bull. Arch. Inst. Sophia 17, 1951, 59-64** known to me from Bull. Epig., REG 65, 1952, no. 87** 67, 1954, no. 177** G. Tibiletti, Ist. Lombard. Scienze a Lettere 86, 1953, 70-71). See above, on C. Cornelius C. f.
See MRR 1.167, Tr. pl. 305 B.C., and 1.168, Aed. cur. 304 B.C. According to M. Seston (REL 29, 1951, 435-436), Cicero's first impression that the Flavius who revealed the Fasti and the Legis actiones was a scriba who lived before 304 (Att. 6.1.8** De Or. 1.186** cf. Plin. NH 33.17) wins support from the discrepancy in the filiation, as it suggests that two different persons have been confused. See L. R. Taylor, VDRR 134-135** A. K. Michels, The Calendar of the Roman Republic 108-118.
Possibly a Leg., lieut. in Spain ca. 42. Against Kubitschek and Mènzer, L. R. Taylor held that the forms Ser and Sergia On the coins issued by these two Manlii (MRR 2.444 and 365 resp.) represent the name of their tribe and are included to distinguish them from the patrician Manlii who used the praenomina A. and T., though not Q. (VDRR 229-230).
In MRR 1.53, in accord with the OCT edition of Livy 4.7.10-12, and 8.7 by Conway and Walters, these names are listed as consules suffecti in 444. See however B. W. Frier?s explanation of their insertion from the Libri Lintei of Licinius Macer, and his argument that they formed in that record another consular college between Varronian years 444 and 443 (TAPhA 105, 1975, 79-97). Note also that like Mommsen he regards their appearance as censors as an invention.
Praetor 33. Asellius (not in RE). Praetor suff. 33. See MRR 2.415. The nomen in Dio (49.43.7) is L. Asyllius (#, emended to Asellius by Pighius). Note the same spelling in the cognomen of L. Sempronius Asellio (MRR 2.10, note 3, 96 B.C.). Badian suggests that the praetors listed above were also later Sempronii Aselliones (PACA 11, 1968, 2-6, with extensive discussion of their possible connections). In MRR 2.415, refer also to Acro on Hor. Sat. 2.2.50, Asellius praetor. (TJC)[25x]
Pr. 44. Delete the gentilicium Calpurnius in MRR 2.319 and 434, and Index, 609. He was the son of RE no. 10, M. Pupius Piso M. f. Frugi, Cos. 61. Monetalis. In MRR 2.434, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.442-443, no. 418, 61 B.C. Quaestor, date unknown, but before 49 if he was Pompey's legate recruiting at Delos in 49 (see above, on no. 10, Cos. 61). Praetor 44. See MRR 2.319** Cic. Phil. 3.25** cf. Phil. 2.62, and Syme, CPh 50, 1955** JRS 50, 1960, 14-16-RP 2.501-503. ,
Cos. Suff. 40. Praefectus fabrum of Caesar during his praetorship in 62 and his consulship in 59 (Cic. Balb. 63), perhaps also during his proconsulate in Hisp. Ult. in 61-60. Pro praetore, 41? If the coins with the inscription Balbus Pro Pr refer to him rather than to his nephew (see MRR 2.381), they should date before his consulship. In MRR 2.381, and Index, 550, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.526-527, no. 518, 41 B.C., who rejects the possibility of an issue in Spain.
Cos. 83. Monetalis. In MRR 2.437, and Index, 555-556? refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.319, no. 311, 106 B.C. Procos. 85. He was governor of Macedonia rather than Illyria in 85 (see MRR 2.58, 59, note 2** Badian, Studies 80-81** Sumner, Orators 104). On his priesthood, see below, on L. Cornelius Sulla (392). Cos. 88, 80. Diodorus (38.16) also mentions his attempt to start a rising against Sulla in his consulship (see MRR 2.62, 65, note 1).
Pr. 218, suff. 216, and 213? Sumner suggests that in the text of Liv. 26.23.7 (211 B.C., MRR 1.276) Lepidus' praenomen should be emended from M. to M'., thus excluding the Lepidus (67) listed above and inserting M'. Aemilius Lepidus, son of M'. Aemilius Numida, as his father's successor in 211 as Xvir s. f. This M'. would then be the father of the M. Aemilius Lepidus (70). Cos. 158, whose filiation was M'. f. M'. n. (See Sumner, Orators 47, 64-65, and the stemma, 66.)
Flamen dialis. See MRR 2.486, and 1.407, note 6. Sumner has offered the attractive suggestion that the short-lived P. Cornelius Scipio, prognatum Publio, of CIL 1_.2.10-ILS 4, was son of P. Scipio, the son of Africanus who was an augur (see MRR 1.390). His brief tenure of the priesthood, as flamen dialis, may be dated either within the period from 182 to 174 or from 173 to 169, where there are large lacunae in Livy's text, perhaps in 175 (Orators 36).
Cos. Suff. 34. See MRR 2.411 and 416. Cadoux holds that the consul of 34 may well be a descendant of such known Herennii as the consul of 93. But if he was the father of the consul suffectus Of A.D. 1 (M. Herennius M. f. M'. n. Picens) his filiation should be M'. f. See PIR_ H 118** Wiseman, NM 235, no. 205. If the Picene leader in the Social War, T. Herennius, was his grandfather his praenomen would be omitted, as in the case of Asinius Pollio's grandfather.[101x]
Q(uaestor). In MRR 2.77, 81 B.C., refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.397, no. 381, 80 B.C. As in MRR (loc cit.), J. F. Mitchell (Historia 15, 1966, 26-27) identifies him with the Torquatus who was praetor in 70 (RE no. 70), and governor of Africa before 68 (RE no. 76), but H. B. Mattingly holds that he was not a Torquatus but son of A. Manlius (12), leg., lieut. in 107-105 (MRR 1.552), Rev. Arch. Narbonnaise 1972, 13 (not available to me, but cited by Crawford, loc. Sit.).
Cos. 144. An incomplete milestone, found at Vulci, gives the name of an Aurelius Cotta, consul (.. ]AV[...|[C]otta Co[s]), and the distance from Rome. It points to the builder of the Via Aurelia and must be earlier than the date of its extension in the Via Aurelia Scauri, in 109. The consul of 144, or perhaps L. Aurelius Cotta (99). Cos. 119, may be meant. See A. Degrassi, Scritti vari 3.33-34** cf. E. Fentress, Via Aurelia, Via Aemilia, PBSR 52, 1984, 72-76.
Senator in 129. The praenomen is M. in the Smyrna copy of the SC de agro Pergameno (see now Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73). The difference in tribe from no. 25, below, suggests that he may be a Lucilius Rufus, perhaps an uncle of the monetalis (MRR 2.444** but see now Crawford, RRC 1.327, no. 324). See A. B. West, AJPh 49, 1928, 240-253. (LRT) On the possibility that the date should be ca. 101, see above, on M'. Aquillius (10). Cos. 129 or M'. Aquillius (11), Cos 101.
See MRR 2.72. His cognomen was probably Afella (Badian, JRS 57, 1967, 227-228). Put to death at Sulla's command when he persisted in an illegal candidacy for the consulship (App. BC 1.101). Dated to 82 by Badian, CR 9, 1959, 274, rev. of E. Gabba, ed. Appian, BC 1. Against Appian's statement that he was a knight who had held no magistracies, Sumner suggests that he had held the praetorship and offended by moving for the consulship immediately (Veil. 2.27.6** Orators 107).
Cos. 104. He probably governed a province either in his consulship or as proconsul after it, since he was accused of res repetundae and acquitted (Cic. Font. 24** Val. Max. 8.5.2). The date would be late in 103 or early in 102, since the prosecutor was M. Gratidius (Cic. Brut. 168** De Or. 2.2), who was killed while serving as a praefectus under M. Antonius in Cilicia (MRR 1.569). See Malcovati, ORF2 nos. 54 and 55, pp. 206-207** and Gruen, RPCC 174-176, 192-193.
In MRR 2.411, Promagistrates, add: if he was Pollio's older brother his praenomen should be Cn. For the cognomen, see Catullus 12.1** Wiseman, NM 215, no. 49. Cn. Asinius Cn. f. (Arn.?) (12), named in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus, may well be Marrucinus, who since he was proconsul of Asia ca. 34, was very probably a praetor before then and a senator by 39 (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 57, 69). Cf. Badian, ZPE 55, 1984, 107-109: Marrucinus may not be a cognomen.
Cos. 251, in 250 over the Carthaginians at Panormus, may be attributed to one or other of the above (see Crawford, RRC 1.287, no. 262, 128 B.C.). The stones marking the boundary between Patavium and Ateste (CIL 1_.633, 634, 2501** cf. ILLRP 476) may be attributed to either Metellus Diadematus, above, or to L. Caecilius Q. f. L. n. Metellus Calvus (83). Cos. 142.[38]
Praetor, uncertain date. Gellius (13.20.12), our only source, states that this son of the consul of 118 (10) was curule aedile and praetor, and died in Gallia Narbonensis, but makes no mention of a provincial command. Dates are uncertain, but twenty-five to thirty years after the father?s consulship is not unreasonable, and his offices probably precede the Social War (MRR 2.13, 18, and 22). See Gabba, Republican Rome 66, no. 92 (Praetor 78?)** Badian, Mel. Piganiol 906-918.
Pr. 73. See MRR 2.109. His praenomen is not attested. The name is given as Clodius in Plutarch and Frontinus, as Clodius Glaber in Florus, but as Claudius Pulcher, legatus of P. Varenus, in Livy (Per. 95), while in Appian (BC 1.116) the names of Claudius Glaber and P. Varinius (1) have been confused (Mènzer, Philologus 55, 1896, 387-389** E. Gabba, Comm. on App., ad loc.). On C. Claudius Glaber, praetorius, in the consilium of 73, see the previous note.
Senator in 129. Being no. 15 in the list of members of the consilium in the SC de agro Pergameno of 129, he was probably above the lowest rank. If so, he may be Rubrius (1). Tr. Pl. 133?, rather than C.? Rubrius (2). Tr. Pl. 123 or 122. (LRT) His tribe is given as Poplilia in Copy A of the SC and Pupinia in Copy B (Sherk, RDGE no. 12), but note AEpig. 1941, 148-ILLRP 341: C. Rubrio C. f. Pop(lilia). On the dating to 129, see above, on M?. Aquillius (10).
Delete the number 26 in MRR 2.464, and in the Index, 582. Identified by Cichorius (RS 253-257) with L. Cella (Bell. Afr. 89.1** MRR 2.476), L. Pella, the praetorius (Plut. Brut. 35, 42 B.C.), and L. Iulius Mocilla Qulius 362** MRR 2.464), also a praetorius. Atticus aided him after Philippi (Nep. Att. 11.2). See Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.415, on Att. 10.10.4. If he was L. Pella, a praetorius, he should be distinguished from Livius Ocella (26), quaestor in Spain.[126x]
Quaestor? 43. The phrase in Cic. Att. 16.14.4, to the effect that Cicero's nephew Quintus was intending ex Nonis its quibus nos magna gessimus aedem Opis explicaturum, idque ad populum, indicates that he was then (November 12, 44) expecting to enter office as quaestor on December 5. See Shackleton Bailey, CLA 6.307, who remarks that in this period the fact that he was several years short of the legal age for the quaestorship (30) was not a fatal objection.
An officer, probably a legatus, under C. Annius in Spain in 81, who defeated and killed L. Livius Salinator (MRR 2.78) at the Pyrenees and opened the way for Annius to attack Sertorius (Sall. Hist. 1.96M, cf. 97** Plut. Sert. 7). Cicero mentions him (Off.' 3.66) as of a date before 91 when the father of Cato Uticensis was still alive. Perhaps a son of the monetalis P. Calpurnius (17). (RS, MS-RP 1.278). On the provinces, see Badian, M21. Piganiol 901ff.
Quaestor 63, Tr. pl. 57. In MRR 2.168, 202, and Index, 564, delete the cognomen Gallus, mistakenly added to the superscription in Cic. Fam. 7.27. See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 116-RP 2.594** Wiseman, NM 230, no. 169** Shackleton Bailey, CR 12, 1962, 195-196. Cicero's reference in Fam. 5.18 to achievement on the part of Fadius beyond that of many homines novi implies that he may have advanced to higher office before his conviction in court (Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.350).
Tr. mil. of uncertain date, but probably before 200. An early inscription of Tusculum reads as follows: M. Fourio C. f. tribunos / militare de praidad Maurte dedet (CIL 1_.2.49-ILS 3142? ILLRP 221** cf. CIL 1_.2.48). Mènzer suggests that his cognomen was Crassipes (see no. 56) and that he was a praetor in 187 and 173 (MRR 1.368, 408). See Suolahti, Junior Ofcers 309, 405. (RS, CP** LRT) Refer also to ILLRP 100** and to P. Pocetti, MEFR 94, 1982, 657-674.
A possible candidate for the consulship of 52 (Cic. QF 3.6 [8].6), and perhaps the praetorius of 54 called Cato in the Mss (QF 3.4.1). See MRR 2.215-216. Shackleton Bailey (CQF 223) joins Constans (Ciceron, Lettres III, p. 257) in suggesting that the name Gutta may be a nickname for one of the known candidates, Plautius Hypsaeus or Metellus Scipio.

Prefect. In MRR 2.313, and Index, 549, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.486, no. 476, 45 B.C. Praetor, uncertain date. A certain C. Cluvius, who had been elected consul, but had been unable to assume office, was advanced to consular rank by Augustus in 29 (Dio 52.42.4). Despite the irregularities of the period he had probably held the lower offices. (TJC) Identification is uncertain since two Cluvii are known in this period (PIR_ 2.286f., nos. 1213, 1214).
Maternal grandfather of Livia Augusta. He is described in Suet. Cal. 23 as a municipal magistrate of Fundi who held honores in Rome (undefined) but through confusion the reading is Aufidium Lyrgonem** cf. Suet. Tib. 5. The name of Livia's mother was Alfidia (ILS 125), but there is no evidence that her father held office in Rome. On the name, see also CIL 2.1667** IGRP 4.983. See J. Linderski, Historia 23, 1974, 463-480** T. P. Wiseman, Historia 14, 1965, 334-335.
Since he assisted in the prosecution of Milo in 52 (Ascon. 34C), he very probably gained entrance to the Senate before 31, and, if he is the ..]# named in the SC de Mitylenaeis (IGRP 4.33** but Sherk, RDGE no. 26, col. c, 14, p. 150, reads ..]#), he was certainly there in 25. Mommsen and Mènzer (RE no. 15) suggest that the senator of 25 was son of no. 299, but the order of names, though fragmentary, is in favor of an older man. (TJC)
Cos. 48, 41. Quaestor 61. As he was a senator, and spoke as a junior member among the last in a debate in March 60 (Cic. Att. 1.19.9), his quaestorship should be dated in or before 61 (cf. MRR 2.184). Augur before 46. In MRR 2.292-293, 47 B.C., insert his name with a reference to Fam. 13.68.2, in which Cicero addresses him as collega. See Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.375. Cf. MRR 2.255, and see above, on L. Marcius Philippus (77).
Cos. Suff. 31. See now Nachtr•ge, RE 8A.2.2389-2390. On his praetorship in 40 (see MRR 2.380), it is preferable to accept the version in Joseph. BJ 1.284-285** Octavian convened the Senate, and Valerius and Sempronius introduced Herod. In any case he was a praetorius by or before 34. On his command against the Salassi in 34-33, see Appian, Illyr. 17, Dio 49.38.3** W. Schmitthenner, Historia 7, 1958, 207, 234-236.[213x]
A combination of praenomina favored by the Cornelii Cethegi. One of these senators of 129 (see Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73), more probably the former because of his apparently praetorian rank, was probably the son of Cn. Cornelius Cethegus (93). Cos. 160, but the difference of tribe excludes the other. An L. Cornelius might be a Sisenna, but the praenomen M. is not attested among them. (LRT) On the date, see above, on M'. Aquillius (10).

Pr. 51. Quaestor. H. B. Mattingly attributes an SC denarius to his quaestorship in 64 or 63, has him give games at Praeneste, probably the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae, and would date his term in Cyrene (Cic. Planc. 13 and 63** NC 16, 1956, 198f.** cf. MRR 2.175) to a proquaestorship in the following year. G. Perl holds to a date ca. 63, and rejects any association with Praeneste or the games of Sulla (Klio 52, 1970, 330-331** 53, 1971, 370-373).
Quaestor in 44 under Pollio in Hisp. Ult. In MRR 2.325, refer also to Cic. Att. 15.13.4, Balbillus, and Shackleton Bailey, CLA 6.295. Possibly the L. Cornelius - f. - n. who was cos. suff. in 32, but Degrassi (Inscr. Ital. 13.1.288) and Groag (PIR_ C nos. 1313 and 1338) suggest L. Cornelius Cinna (32, cf. 104), esp. as Velleius (2.51.3) describes him as ex privato consularis. On his pontificate, see M. W. H. Lewis, Priests 29, no. 14.
See MRR 2.471. The precise date of his tribunate of the plebs and of his Lex frumentaria remains uncertain, but identification of him as son of Cn. Octavius (17). Cos. 128, and younger brother of Cn. Octavius (20). Cos. 87, strongly favors some year between the death of Saturninus and the death of his brother, hence between 99 and 87. See D. C. Earl, Latomus 19, 1960, 665** Sumner, Orators 114-116** J. G. Schovanek, Historia 21, 1972, 235-243.
Leg., lieut. ca. 96. In MRR 2.10, delete the question mark, for in Diod. 37.8.1 he is called #. The Publius named in the same passage of Diodorus, a Roman eques resident in Syracuse, should perhaps be noted as possibly an officer. Since this section of Diodorus lists retrospectively examples of good and evil the dating is less orderly than usual but the limits are given by references to the slave revolt in Sicily and to Livius Drusus.
Senator in 39, listed in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus. According to J. M. Reynolds (Aphrodisiac and Rome 72) the kappa of the nomen ]# is clear, although cognomen and tribe (Fab.) are consistent with the name of T. Atinius Tyrannus in the SC de Panamareis (Sherk, RDGE 158, no. 27). Cf. MRR 2.488. Badian, in comments on the names in the SC (ZPE 55, 1984, 111-112) is also inclined to favor the name T. Atinius Tyrannus.
Cos. 63. In MRR 2.165-166, add that in December 63 he advanced from near Faesulae against Catiline, who was near Pistoria (Sell. Cat. 57.3-5** Sumner, CPh 58, 1963, 215-219). Proconsul in Macedonia, 62-60. The charge against him in his trial in 59 after his return from Macedonia was more probably res repetundae than vis or maiestas (Cic. Vat. 27** Schol. Bob. 94St: see E. S. Gruen, Latomus 32, 1973, 301-310** cf. MRR 2.175).
Leg., lieut.? 46. See MRR 2.300. He had held offices earlier (Bell. Afr. 57.3). He may be identified with M. Aquinus (5** cf. 2), Leg., lieut. under Cassius in 43 and 42 (MRR 2.364, and insert him for 43 in 2.352). Appian's reference in BC 2.119 to an # who joined the liberators after the murder of Caesar favors the identification (TJC). On his coinage in 43-42, see Crawford, RRC 1.513, no. 498. See also Wiseman, NM 214, no. 36.
Monetalis. Crawford rightly identifies the monetalis with RE no. 232, who was quaestor in 48, not with no. 233, his son (as suggested with a query in MRR 2.437), who was pr. in 29 and cos. in 18, and dates his coinage to 50. In MRR 2.437, and Index, 554, read (232), and add Crawford,  RRC 1.460, no. 439, 50 B.C. On his quaestorship, MRR 2.274, 48 B.C., refer also to Oros. 6.15.19. See Sumner, Orators 93, 133, 143.
Cos. 185. In MRR 1.331, 332, note 4, Ap. Claudius, the tr. mil. who attended Flamininus in his conference with Philip of Macedonia at Nicaea in 198, has been mistakenly confused with Nero, one of the envoys sent by Flamininus to the Senate in that year. He is termed legatus in 194 (Liv. 34.40.10** MRR 1.344), and was probably one during his years of service with Flamininus. See Badian, T. Quinctius Flamininus 44-45, and note 57. **
Flamen Dialis? The apex on the coins of T. Q(uinctius?) (Flamininus?) (48), as well as the Macedonian shield (see MRR 2.450** and Crawford, RRC 1.291, no. 267, 126 B.C.) point to descent through T. Quinctius Flamininus (45). Cos. 198, to his grandfather Lucius, who was presumably the flamen from whom the family cognomen was derived (see Mènzer, APF 117ff.** Gundel, RE s. v. Quinctius, 991-992, and 1039-1040** Badian, JRS 61, 1971, 102-111).
Pr. urb. 83. Shackleton Bailey (CQF 192-193, on QF 2.11 [10].3** and Studies 19) finds better MSS authority for the form Burrenus in Pro Quinctio 25, 30, and 69, and (see also Wiseman NM 217, no. 71) connects the word with Cicero's punning joke in QF. But see now H. I. McAdam and N. J. Munday (CPh 78, 1983, 131-136), who reject the word Bostrenum (man of Bostra) in QF above, and suggest 0sroenum** cf. G. W. Bowersock, Roman Arabia 36-37.
Pr. 59. In MRR 2.179, Aediles, delete this entry, as the reference is to C. Sentius Saturninus (see below)** at 2.188, Praetors, delete the cognomen Saturninus and the reference to Cic. Planc. 19** at 2.197, Promagistrates, delete the cognomen Saturninus. See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 111, 121-122, and on the Sentii, RP 2.582-604** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 14-15. This Appuleius may be L. Appuleius L. f. Ser. listed in Joseph. AJ 14.220.
Quaestor 148. See MRR 1.461. P. A. MacKay rejects Gabler's dates for the quaestorships of C. Publilius and L. Fulcinnius in Macedonia (146, under L. Mummius, and 148, under Metellus Macedonicus, respectively), and returns, primarily basing his argument on the nature of the coin types, to Lenormant's dating of 168 or 167. He would assign C. Publilius to 168 and L. Fulcinnius to 167, both under Aemilius Paullus (ANSMuN 14, 1968, 5-13).
Tr. pl. before 90? See MRR 2.490. Against Gruen's suggestion (RPCC 300) that his cognomen was Brutus, Sumner remarks that Cicero does not include the nomen when referring to a Brutus, a Silanus, or a Pennus. Rejecting identification of the P. Sextius whose condemnation Iunius secured (Brut. 180) with the quaestor of 111 (MRR 1.541), he dates this tribunate independently of the trial between ca. 95 and ca. 85 (Orators 109).[111]
Prefect? at Sulmo, in 49. The officer who fled from Sulmo before Caesar's advance in 49 (MRR 2.270-271) is identified by Mènzer with Q. Lucretius Vespillo (36), a commander in Pompey's fleet in 49-48 (MRR 2.283). The identification is probable, although Caesar's use of two forms of the name may indicate two different persons (BC 1.18, Q. Lucretio senatore, therefore at least of quaestorian rank** 3.7.1, Lucretius Vespillo).
See MRR 2.237, Quaesitores, and 240, note 3. According to Mommsen (StR 2?.584) the presiding officer of a quaestio de vi was never a magistrate in office (see also J. Linderski, HSPh 76, 1972, 195-198, note 59). Considius, the quaesitor in 52, may be either M. Considius Longus (11), procos. in Africa 51-50, or M. Considius Nonianus, who was allotted the succession to Caesar in Cisalpine Gaul in 49 (MRR 2.242, 250, 261).
Tr. mil. 86 (MRR 2.55) and Leg., envoy 81 (MRR 2.78). See now D. G. Glew, Chiron 11, 1981, 118-119. Badian would identify the tr. mil. of 86 and the leg., envoy of 81 with RE no. 11, the consul of 58. The interval would not be surprising in view of the delayed attainment of the consulship by two other supporters of Pompey, M. Piso and L. Afranius (Badian, Philologus 103, 1959, 87-99). See now C. Nicolet et al., Insula sacra 48-53.
A son of L. Aelius Tubero (150)** the famous jurisconsult to whom Dionysius of Halicarnassus dedicated his essay on Thucydides, husband of a daughter of Servius Sulpicius Rufus, with sons who attained the consulship in 11 and 4, respectively, he was almost certainly a senator before 31 (PIR_ 1.25, no. 157, and 45, no. 274** De Laet, nos. 7 and 12** see W. Kunkel, Herkunft u. Sozialestellung der råmischen Juristen 37, no. 56).
Pr. before 73. Since C. Licinius Sacerdos (154). Pr. 75, is listed after him in the consilium of 73 (SIG? 747** Sherk, RDGE no. 23, 133-138** see MRR 2.114-115), he was probably father or older brother, already a praetorius, of the praetor of 73, and his praetorship, though later than that of Marcellus, may be several years earlier. See L. R. Taylor, VDRR 204** Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 138, on SIG? 747.
Pr. 212. According to Livy (26.29.10) he was sent with Scipio to Spain as propraetor, but on the strength of the phrase eodem lure eodem imperio mecum, i.e., with Scipio (Liv. 28.28.14), both Jashemski, Procon. And Propr. Imperium 25-26, and Sumner, Arethusa 3, 1970, 85-88, rightly hold that he was sent in 210 with imperium pro consule like Scipio himself (cf. MRR 1.280). See above, on C. Claudius Nero (246). Cos. 207.
Quaestor under Verres in Sicily at Lilybaeum in 73 (Cic. Div. in Caec. 4, cf. 30). He was involved in the case of Agonis (ibid. 55). Probably among those of his staff who left Verres at the end of his first year ( Verr. 2.2.49). See also MRR 2.117 for other references. On the legati and quaestores under Verres in Sicily from 73 to 71, see now N. Marinone, AAT 100, 1965-66, 219-252, who distributes them as follows???:
Monetalis. In MRR 2.437, and Index, 557, refer also to Crawford RRC 1.249-250, 151 B.C. Crawford would identify this Sulla as either a brother of the dictator's father or a son of the praetor of 186 (384) and grandfather of the dictator, according to the method of counting the generations intended in Veil. 2.17.2, where the dictator is described as sextus a Cornelio Rufino (RE no. 302, Cos. 290 and 277).
Q(uaestor?) 39? In the inscription on his coins minted at Zacynthos (C. Sosius Q. Za), the Q. refers to his quaestorship, which cannot be later than 39, when M. Antonius became imp II (see Sydenham, CRR 199, no. 1271), and Sosius consul designate (App. BC 5.72), but may be slightly earlier. His province as quaestor, perhaps Macedonia, is not indicated. Consul 32. See above, on Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (23). Cos. 32.
Among the names given in this form the evidence for the gentilicium Mallius is sure only for the consul of 105, RE no. 13. The names of the others depend primarily on the forms in Greek inscriptions, in which Dittenberger in 1871 (Hermes 6, 153, note 3) knew of no occurrence of the form #, or in literary references which render the name Manlius by such forms as #, and #. These should all probably be rendered in Latin as Manlii. (LRT)
Cos. 110, Procos. 109-106. Honored by inscriptions of Demetrias (IG 9.2.1135** Bull. Epig. 1954, no. 152** 1955, no. 136a) and one also of Europus of Macedonia for his victories over Gallic Scordisci, and Bessi, and other Thracian tribes (S. Kougeas, Hellenika 5, 1932, 5-16, reported by Roussel, REG 47, 1934, 230** Bull. Epig. 1934, p. 230). On SIG? 710, from Delphi ? ILLRP 337, see Aepig. 1967, no. 453.
(MRR 2.465).Named in I. Priene 121, ll. 15-22, as governors of Asia to whom the honorand went as envoy, but the dates can be listed only as before 90, some perhaps even before 100. A second part of the inscription lists embassies to many cities, and a third includes one to King Seleucus, son of King Antiochus, to be dated either before his accession in 95 or else failing to recognize him as king. See Sumner, GRBS 19, 1978, 147-153** cf. I. Priene 551.
Cos. 487. His name appears in Dion. Hal. (8.64.1, and 67.9** cf. 10.36.4 and 9) and in Cassiodorus as Siccius, and was most probably so in Fast. Cap. (Degrassi, Inscr. It. 13.1.89, 537). J.-C. Richard (Origines de la plebe romaine 529530) accepts Siccius as a patrician, but his colleague C. Aquillius (8) as a plebeian** cf. Momigliano, Quarto Contributo 304** and Ogilvie, Comm. Liv. 337.
Procos. in Africa. As noted in MRR 2.222, his command in Africa in 51 indicates that he had been praetor by or before 54. It seems possible that he was a praetor then, governed Africa from 53 to 50 in succession to P. Attius Varus, and returned in 50 in time to be a candidate for the consulship of 49 (Schol. Gron. 291St** see Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 268, note 41), leaving Q. Ligarius, his legatus, in command.
Quaestor 84, Praetor 75? Monetalis. In MRR 2.440, and Index, 566, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.361, no. 347, before 87 B.C. Propraetor in Gallia Transalpina, 75-73 or 74-72. See MRR 2.104, 109, note 6, for the dates 74-72** cf. Badian, Mel. Piganiol 911-912. If Pompey and his army wintered in Gaul in 75- 74, instead of 74-73, Fonteius' praetorship would be dated to 76, and his command of three years in Gaul to 75- 73.
He is no. 13 on the list of the consilium of Pompeius Strabo at Asculum in 89 (ILS 8888** Cichorius, RS 144-155** Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 111-112** cf. MRR 2.35, 38, note 12, 536). He is listed in MRR with the cognomen Scaurus, as also in Cichorius (RS 140), but Cotta is not impossible, as he might be the future cousul of 74 (L. R. Taylor, VDRR 197** see now Badian, Klio 66, 1984, 300).[32]
Cos. 85, 84, 82. Tr. Pl. 92, or less probably 91. See MRR 2.18 and 19, note 5, and now Crawford, RRC 1.77 and note 4, cf. 337-339, nos. 337, 338** NC 1964, 142, in favor of 91, and Sumner, Orators 117-118, in favor of 92. Consul 84. In MRR 2.60, on the prevention of elections in 84 by lnfavourable auspices, see L. Cornelius Sisenna, frag. 130P in HRR** see J. Jahn, Interregnum and Wahldiktatur 160.
Cos. 71. Procos. 76, MRR 2.93, and 96, note 4. From this note, R. E. Smith (Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army 17, note 9) would remove the reference to IG 12.5.722, on the ground that the title # can refer only to the pre-Sullan Aufidius of ca. 107, 106 (see MRR 1.551, 552, note 2, 553). On the adoptive name and status of Orestes, see Shackleton Bailey, Studies 84-85** Sumner, Orators 46, 82.
Leg., amb. 280, 279. P. Leveque (Pyrrhus 341-370), reviewing the evidence for the two supposed embassies of both Cineas and Fabricius before and after the battle of Ausculum, accepts the two of Cineas but rejects the second one of Fabricius as dependent on confusion of material in Justin and connected too closely with Roman annalistic anecdotes to be historically reliable. See MRR 1.193, note 3.
Pr.? 67? On his name and identity, see Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.292, on Att. 1.1.2. Against Mènzer (RE), he favors Drumann?s view that while he was a candidate he was adopted by a Marcius Figulus and is the C. Marcius C. f. Figulus who became consul in 64 (see Marcius, RE no.63, above). This would explain the notice Caesare et Turmo in the Chronographer of 354. See also E. W. Gray, Antichthon 13, 1979, 56-65.
On the basis of Cic. Brut. 127-128 and remarks in Sall. Iug. 32.2-3, and  40.1, Sumner suggests that a post as one of Calpurnius Bestia's legates in 111 and 110 may have made him a mark for the Mamilian commission (MRR 1.456), which convicted him, and that Cicero's phrase cecidit in cursu suggests that he may have been planning to run for the praetorship or the consulship in 109 (Orators 73-74).
Pr. 65? See MRR 2.157-158. According to A. M. Ward, he may have been praetor in 66, depending on when he asked Cicero to defend Manilius (TAPhA 101, 1970, 547-556, esp. 548, note 15). See Wiseman, NM 216, no. 58. There is already a surplus of possible praetors in 66, since there were only eight places. Of the nine listed the least likely are those whose aedileships could have been earlier than 69.[28x]
Leg., envoy 85. Sent by Sulla to talk with Fimbria when he requested a colloquy (App. Mith. 60). This envoy, identified by Mènzer (RE 34) and Lintott (Historia 20, 1971, 700 note 22), with the aged consular exile, P. Rutilius Rufus (34), was probably a younger officer, and may have been P. Rutilius Nudus (Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 492** cf. H. Bennett, Cinna and His Times 56-57, note 99). On Nudus, see below.
Tr. pl. 58. In MRR 2.196, on his law to restore the collegia, refer also to Cic. Att. 3.15.4. Curule Aedile 56. In MRR 2.208, on his election, refer also to Cic. QF 2.2.2. XVvir s. f. by 56. See Cic. Har. Resp. 26, ne hoc quidem in mentem veniebat, Sibyllino sacerdoti, haec sacra maiores nostros ex vestris libris expetissent? Cf. J. O. Lenaghan, Comm. on Cicero's Oration De Haruspicum Responso 128-129.
Sumner rejects the statement in Ps.-Cic. (Invect. in Sall. 6.17** 8.21) that Sallust returned to the Senate after his expulsion in 50 by repeating the quaestorship (MRR 2.274), and accepts Dio's statement that he did so by becoming praetor designate in 47, and praetor in 46 (Phoenix 25, 1971, 259** cf. MRR 2.274, 296** Dio 42.52.2). On his career, see Syme, Sallust 29-42** Wiseman, NM 258, no. 372.[184]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.436, and Index, 549, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.222, no. 154, 189-180 B.C., a dating which makes it possible to identify the monetalis with the legatus of 170- 169 (RE no. 1** see MRR 1.422, in Illyricum). Could he have taken from his Macedonian service the cognomen Antipater, which was held in the next generation by the historian? (Sumner, Orators 57, with stemma).
Tr. Pl. 70. R. E. Smith (CQ 7, 1957, 82-85) suggests that 70-69 was the date of the passage of the Lex Plautia agraria and that the law was intended to reward Pompey?s veterans of the war with Sertorius. This Plautius may be the A. Plautius or Plotius (no. 8) who served as a legatus under Pompey in 67, but see MRR 2.149, and 151, note 17. See also Wiseman, NM 251-252, nos. 322-324** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.333.
Praetor 62. Combine the two notices in MRR 2.133, and 155, about his proquaestorship in Sicily. The date is uncertain, but falls more probably in the early 60s, as he held the praetorship in 62. Gundel (RE no. 3) rejects the identification of the propraetor in Sicily with the legate in Macedonia (RE no. 2) in 57-55. The officer at Thapsus in 46 (MRR 2.303) was an ex-praetor (Bell. Afr. 28.1).
Cos. 123. He probably had served under Metellus Macedonicus, his father, in Hisp. Cit. in 143-142 (Frontin. Str. 4.1.11). Cos. 123, Procos. 122-121. On the piracy in the Balearic Islands, their conquest and the settlements in Palma and Pollentia, see M. G. Morgan, CSCA 2, 1969, 217-231. See further Q. Caecilius Q. f. Metellus Macedonicus (94). Cos. 143, Addendum.[36x]
Prefect. Placed in command (#) by M. Lucullus, imperator, of the city of Mesembria on the Pontic coast of Thrace, he was honored by the city as benefactor and patron (Detchev, Bull. Arch. Inst. Sophia 17, 1950, 59-64, known to me from J. and L. Robert, Bull. epig. 1952, p. 156 f. and 1954, no. 177** G. Tibiletti, Governatori romani in citta provinciali, RIL 86, 1953, 64-100, esp. 70f.).
Monetalis. The monetalis Lent Mar F., dated to 100 by Crawford (RRC 1.329, no. 329), is identified with the P. Lentulus of Cic. Brut. 136. Shackleton Bailey notes (as against Mènzer and Crawford, above) that there is no evidence that he used the agnomen Marcellinus, but his descendants did (see Sumner, Orators 143, stemma). Add references to Crawford in MRR 2.437, and Index, 554.
Recorded in an inscription of Terracina of relatively early date: C. PACCIUS C. f. . .. XVIR AD HASTAM [QUAESTOR?] LUDOS HONORIS E[T VIRTUTIS? FECIT] (CIL 10.8260-ILS 5051** PIR P 7). (RS, MS-RP 1.285) See H. W. Benario (Historia 8, 1959, 496-498) for the view that he was C. Paccius Africanus, consul ca. A.D. 66, and later procos. of Africa, in A.D. 77-78, and B. Thomasson, Statthalter 47-48.[153x]
While in command in Gaul in 40 (MRR 2.383) he styled himself on his coins as Q. SALVIUS IMP. COS. DESIG. (see now Crawford, RRC 1.528-529, no. 523, 40 B.C.). Salvius does not appear as his nomen elsewhere. Shackleton Bailey suggests that he was a Q. Salvidienus Rufus, adopted by a Q. Salvius** although he kept his former name, he was officially Q. Salvius Salvidienus Rufus (Studies 64).
senator? L. Sulla P. f., Cos. 5 B.C., was probably a son of this man and grandson of the consul designate for 65 (386), although he might possibly be descended from RE no. 385, the Catilinarian conspirator. It is unlikely that no. 387, who was a young man in 54 (Cic. QF 3.3.2, cf. Sulla 88-89, 62 B.C.) and alive in 46 (Fam. 15.17.2), failed to become a senator if he survived. (TJC)
See MRR 2.476, 492. Senator, at least quaestorius in rank, since he is no. 7 in the list in the SC de Panamareis (Sherk, RDGE 158-162, no. 27) and no. 12 in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 54-92, esp. 57 and 71** cf. Sherk, RDGE 170-172, no. 29), both in 39 B.C. See Badian, ?Notes on a New List of Roman Senators,? ZPE 55, 1984, 101-114, esp. 102 and 111.
In Sumner's review of Shackleton Bailey's Studies (CPh 73, 1978, 159-164), he suggested that Cicero's praise of Varus (homo summa religione et auctoritate praeditus, Cluent. 53** cf. Quinct. 54) reveals a previously unnoticed senator. Shackleton Bailey (Onom.) notes that Cicero used similar terms of praise of Roman knights (e.g. Verr. 2.3.55, M. Cossutius, and 62, the aged Lollius).[177]
Leg., lieut. or praef. class. 36. Read P.? or T.? Carisius. In Appian (BC 5.111) the reading is #, emended to Kapaoup by Gardthausen (Augustus 2.138, note 10) as the gentilicium Carcius is not attested. He may be identified with either T. Carisius (9). Monetalis (below), or with P. Carisius, the future legatus pro praetore in Spain (PIR_ 2.99, no. 422, who is however called # in Dio 53.25.8). (TJC)
Either of these two men, nos. 32 and 37, respectively, in the list in the SC de agro Pergameno (Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73** MRR 2.494, 495), could be son of P. Popillius Laenas (28). Cos. 132, but the difference in tribe excludes one. Since the praenomen Q. does not appear among the Popillii Laenates the probabilities favor the first. (LRT) On the date, see above, M?. Aquillius (10).
Probably a senator in 129, named in the SC de agro Pergameno (Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 132** Sherk, RDGE 66, 70). If Cam. is the correct tribe for the Atilii Serrani (it seems to be Aem. in Joseph. AJ 14.239) this fragmentary name might be taken to be that of the consul of 106, C. Atilius Sex. f. Serranus (64) (Badian, loc. cit.). On the date, see M'. Aquillius (10), above.
Officer in Sicily, legate? under Sex. Pompeius from late 43 to 36 (see MRR 2.479). No. 95 and** he should probably be identified, although there is no evidence that the Cos. suff. of 23 had the cognomen Frugi. If RE no. 95 was pro quaestore in Spain in 49, he may well, but not necessarily, have been quaestor in 50. He should be noted as Cos. suff. 23 in the Index, MRR 2.542.
Cos. suff. 33. The unpublished inscription of Cos which names him as a priest (see MRR 2.486** M. H. Lewis, Official Priests of Rome 62, suggests that he was a pontifex) also makes him the author of a popular measure in 39, presumably as tribune of the plebs (Mènzer, RE, Supbd. 3.258, no. 20** cf. PIR_ 3.197, no. 469). Insert him with a query in MRR ,2.425 among the priests of 31.
See MRR 2.147 and 278-279. E. Gabba (Republican Rome, the Army and the Allies 34, and 191, note 96) points out that according to Plut. Pomp. 78.1 Septimius' position under Pompey in 67 was that of centurion (#** so also in Caes. BC 3.104.3, bello praedonum apud eum ordinem duxerat), and only later did he become tribunus militum (Caes. loc. cit.), his rank in 48 when he murdered Pompey.[191x]
IIIIvir Monetalis. In MRR 2.440, and Index, 565, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.496, no. 485, 43 B.C. If the coins of Chilo could be dated earlier than 43 or 42 as in RE, it would be possible to identify him with the uncertain candidate Flaminius in 44 and the senator Cillo who perished in the proscriptions, but these identifications remain improbable. (RS, CP** TJC) See above, on *Cillo.
Monetalis 56 and quaestor 54. Sydenham dates his SC coins to 62 (CRR 146, nos. 882-884), but H. B. Mattingly to 54, holding that they refer to the celebration of the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae at Praeneste by the quaestor urbanus (NC 16, 1956, 2000** but see Crawford, RRC 1.449-451, no. 426, who dates his coinage to 56. Enter this reference in MRR 2.437, and Index, 557.
Praetor 43? See MRR 2.339. Porphyrio on Hor. Sat. 1.7, reports his service with P. Attius Varus in Africa in 49 (MRR 2.260), and his service with Brutus in Asia in 42 (MRR 2.361** Porphyr., Ps.-Acro, and Comm. Cruq. on Hor. Sat. 1.7). Probably the P. Rupilius P. f. Men. named in Cic. Fam. 13.9** cf. Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.479. See Wiseman, NM 257, no. 366** Badian, Historia 13, 1964, 143.
I Cos. suff. 44. Tr. pl. 47. The evidence for the transfer of this patrician to the plebs by adoption in 48 is given in Dio 42.29.1, and the name R Lentulus is attested in Ascon. 5C** cf. Cic. Att. 12.28.3, and 30.1** Plut. Cic. 41.4** Macrob. Sat. 2.3.3. (TJC) See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 29- 32, 112, and Onom., on his name in adoption and his adoptive father.
In MRR 2.443, and Index, 577, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.372, no. 358, 83 B.C. This date makes it possible to suggest that he was also the father of M. Iuventius Laterensis (16), Pr. 51. Cicero's reference in Planc. 51 (quid imaginibus tuis, quid ornatissimo et optimo viro, patri tuo) implies attainment of senatorial and curule rank. (RS, MS-RP 1.282-283)[115]
Cos. Suff. 34. On his adoption by L. Calpurnius Bestia (25), and his name, see ILS 9461, and Shackleton Bailey, Studies 129. On his coinage while legatus under Antony in Greece (MRR 2.389), see now Crawford, RRC 1.533, no. 530, ca. 39 B.C. Note the inscription L. ATRATINVS AVGVR On his coins. On his command of a fleet as legatus pro praetore, see ILS 9461, ca. 36.
Prefect under Cicero in Cilicia in 51-50 (MRR 2.246, 254). He was very probably father of L. Volusius Saturninus, Cos. Buff. 12, one of a family which, according to Tacitus (Ann. 3.30), had not risen beyond the praetorship. Hence he may have become a praetor. See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 126, and NM 277- 278. no. 514** Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 156 (on his marriage to a Claudia) -RP 2.605-606.
Praetor 76, Procos. Asia 75-74. See MRR 2.93 and 98, 100 note 6. A. M. Ward has shown that the uncertain manuscript tradition regarding the name of this governor of Asia just before the Third Mithridatic War, and at the time of Caesar's capture by pirates and execution of them when he captured them in turn, is best taken to represent the name M. Iunius Iuncus (AJAH 2, 1977, 26-36).
Dict. 333. On these and the magistrates of the other Dictator years, 324, 309, and 301, see A. Drummond, The Dictator Years, Historia 27, 1978, 550-572: they were an invention which appears first in connection with the Liber Andalis of Atticus (Cic. Brut. 72** cf. 13-15), and may perhaps have been used to justify Caesar's annual dictatorships. See MRR 1.141.
Cos. 113, Cens. 102. For the view that Caprarius, not Metellus Numidicus, was the one who rebuilt the temple of the Magna Mater (Ovid Fasti 4.347-348), and did so between his triumph in 111 and his censorship in 102, with booty won during his proconsulship in Macedonia and Thrace from the Scordisci, see M. G. Morgan, Klio 55, 1973, 235-245.
Pr. 72. Both he and Arrius (7) are termed praetor in Liv. Per. 96. Arrius as the intended successor to Verres probably held the praetorship in 73 and was a promagistrate in 72. For Manlius we have no such evidence, but his career may be parallel, since the praetors had charge of the courts in Rome. He is listed in MRR (2.116) at the latest possible date, but 73 may be more probable.
Cos. 173. An honorary inscription of Telesia is attributed to him (with the cognomen Laenates) (Quilici, Quaderni Ist. Topografia 2, 1966, 100-101, cited by A. Degrassi, Acta 5th Internat. Congress Gr. & Lat. Epig. 164). It should perhaps be referred to a later Popillius (J. M. Reynolds, JRS 61, 1971, 139). Censor 159. In MRR 1.445-446, refer also to Plin. NH 34.30.
Legatus of Lucullus, attested in 72, 69, and 68 (MRR 2.120, 134, 140). Note also an inscription of Acmonia in Phrygia # (MAMA 6.260-AEpig. 1940, 200), and Syme's suggestion that his cognomen was Barba, and that he, not a Cassius, was the Barba who was a legate of Lucullus in 73 (MRR 2.112). See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 123-RP 2.601-602** Wiseman, NM 262, no. 406, and 280, no. 525.[199x]
Tr. mil. 69. He should be identified with L. Cassius Longinus (64). Pr. 66 (MRR 2.152), with the juror in the case of Oppianicus (Cic. Cluent. 107), thus making him a senator in 74, and with the juror in the case of Verres in 70 ( Verr. 1.30). See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 24. Reference in Verr. 1.30 to the severitas of his family suggests that he was a Longinus (cf. Asconius 46C).
Cos. 223, 217. Tribune of the plebs 232. See MRR 1.225. The Lex de modo agrorum mentioned by Appian (BC 1 .8) and Plutarch (TG 8.2) is attributed to Flaminius by A. Valvo, Miscell. Gr. a Lat. 5, 1977, 179-224** cf. E. Gabba, Comm. on App. BC 1.7 and 8. Refer also to an inscription found near Spina that mentions Galicos colonos (G. Uggeri, Atene a Roma 22, 1977, 128-137).
Senator in 129. His relatively early place in the consilium listed in the SC de agro Pergameno (no. 16) and the date invalidate attempts to identify him with C. Licinius Nerva (124). Tr. pl. between 120 and 111. L. R. Taylor (VDRR 224-225) suggests C. Licinius Crassus (52). Tr. pl. 145. See Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73. But see above, on M'. Aquillius (10), on the date.
Leg., envoy 48. Mènzer (RE no. 8), on the basis of Cic. Fam. 6.12.2 and App. BC 2.58-60, would identify this friend of Caesar as not a Postumius at all but as C. Curtius (Rabirius) Postumus (Rabirius 6). This is accepted by Shackleton Bailey, Studies 60** CLF 2.392. Note also the Postumus associated with Matius in Att. 15.2.3** and Bell. Afr. 26.2, on Rabirius Postumus.
Q(uaestor ad) A(erarium)? See MRR 2.287. Since no Pompeian quaestor was elected to office after 50, Sumner rejects Grant?s view that this man was a Pompeian quaestor in Africa in 47 or 46, and suggests that if Grant is correct about the office Pomp(onius) must be regarded as a quaestor of 49 who continued for two years as pro quaestore (Phoenix 25, 1971, 263)
Senator by 70. The C. Gallus (MRR 2.491), senator and advisor of one of Verres' victims (Cic. Verr. 2.3.151), whom Mènzer doubtfully identifies with C. Gallius, perhaps a legatus under Antonius Creticus (SIG? 748, Gytheum), may more probably be identified with the famous jurist C. Aquillius Gallus (23). Pr. 66 (Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 496** Wiseman, NM 281, no. 536).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.454, and Index, 626, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.352-356, no. 344, 89 B.C. Legatus of Pompey in Spain, in 75-74 (or 74-73) (see MRR 2.100** and on Cn. Pompeius Magnus [31], above). He brought 15 cohorts to winter in Celtiberia when Pompey retreated for the winter to Gaul (Sall. Hist. 2.94, 95M: Titurius). See Wiseman, NM 267, no. 438.[206]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.436, and Index, 551, refer also to Crawford, RRC[63] 1.239-241, no. 189, 169-158 B.C. Crawford would date his praetorship to the late 140s, but Sherk, RDGE no. 4, p. 39, to 165-160 B.C.** see MRR 1.438, 165 B.C.** but cf. H. B. Mattingly, NC 1969, 103-104, who makes a good case for a later date** and below, on Cn. Egnatius, Procos. Macedonia.
Tr. pl. and Leg., lieut. See MRR 2.469, 483. Wiseman, taking Cicero's list in Leg. Man. 58 as presented in the order of seniority, attributes his tribunate and his legateship in successive years to the period before 81 (CQ 14, 1964, 122-123) but in NM 230, no. 170, adds (or tr. pl. 68, leg. 67?)** see also Syme JRS 53, 1963, 55-60-RP 2.557-565** Historia 13, 1964, 106-RP 2.583.
Aed. Cur. 44. Note that while the spelling in ILS 6075 favors a relatively early date, both Dessau and Mènzer remain uncertain whether the aedile in question was the consul of 23 (RE no. 92) or his father (91). Reference to Terentius (2). Tr. pl. 54, is probably irrelevant, since a Varro Murena would hardly be referred to as simply Terentius. (TJC)[204]
Mag. eq. 333. On these and the magistrates of the other Dictator years, 324, 309, and 301, see A. Drummond, The Dictator Years, Historia 27, 1978, 550-572: they were an invention which appears first in connection with the Liber Andalis of Atticus (Cic. Brut. 72** cf. 13-15), and may perhaps have been used to justify Caesar's annual dictatorships. See MRR 1.141.
In the SC de Sarapeo Deli Insulae (SIG? 664** Sherk, RDGE no. 5, 37-39, ca. 164) the tribe is not given with the names of the other two witnesses. L. R. Taylor (VDRR 204) suggests that it is given in order to distinguish him from other branches of the Claudii such as the Nerones, who were in Arnensis. His cognomen could have been Asellus.
Perhaps a relative of Pilia, wife of Atticus. See the full discussion by Geza Alfåldy in Aquileia Nostra 51, 1980, 257-264.[156x]
Praetor procos. in Hisp. Ult., 143. See MRR 1.472, 474, note 3. Appian's phrase (Ib. 66, #) strongly favors placing Quinctius (Crispinus?) in command of Hisp. Ult., instead of Hisp. Cit., as successor in 143 of Fabius Maximus Aemilianus and succeeded in 142 by Fabius Maximus Servilianus (MRR 1.477-478). See Astin, Historia 13, 1964, 251-254** R. C. Knapp, Aspects 196, 201-203.
Probably a tr. mil. He was at Asculum in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo (ILS 8888** CIL 1_.709, 6.37045). He might be the monetalis L. Vol. L. f. Strabo (see below, Vol(lumnius) [3 and  14]), and may be identified with the senator Volumnius, Cicero?s friend (Fam. 7.32.1). See Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 113-114** and Suolahti, Junior Officers 313, 397.[223x]
Leg., lieut. under his brother in Transalpine Gaul (see MRR 2.170). W. Allen noted that according to Sall. Cat. 42 Murena appeared to have authority in Cisalpina too (CPh 48, 1953, 176-177), but Badian, showing how promptly Metellus Celer took authority there, restricts Murena to Transalpina and reads in ulteriore Gallia in Sall. Cat. 42.3 (Mel. Piganiol 915-918).
Tr. Mil. 71. Perhaps better dated with Mènzer to 72** see above, on Julius Caesar (131). If he is the C. Popillius who was tr. Pl. in 68 (see MRR 2.138) he may have been quaestor in 70 or, like the three military tribunes of 69 (Cic. Verr. 1.30** MRR 2.133), he was already a senator before becoming a tr. Mil. (Syme, JRS 53, 1963, 55-60-RP 2.557-567** Sumner, Orators 136).
Pr. 60. In MRR 2.183, correct the gentilicium to M. Atius Balbus, the form which appears in inscriptions of Aricia (see CIL 14.2179, 2180), and is right for the maternal grandfather of Augustus (RS, CP). Wiseman, NM 216, no. 56, is sceptical of Suet. Aug. 4** cf. Cic. Phil. 3.16. See also Historia 14, 1965, 333-334, and Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.374, on Att. 2.12.1.
Cos. suff. 176. Leg., amb. 173, no. c (MRR 1.409). Valerius and the other members of this embassy were sent to other cities and states as well, Pergamum, Syria, cities in Asia and perhaps in Cappadocia and Bithynia too: cf. in 172, Liv. 42.17.1 and 26.7-9 (MRR 1.414** see Meloni, Perseo 149, 163, 165, notes 2 and 3, and 166** Walbank, Comm. Poly& 3.289).
Prefect in Samos, of uncertain date. He was honored with his wife Magilia in a Samian inscription with lettering of the first century B.C. (SEG 1.388). His daughter Aeficia Calvina was honored in Athens (IG 2_ 4243** cf. Suet. Gramm. 3). (RS, CP) See now E. Rawson, LCM 4, 1979, 53-58** T. E. Kinsey, ibid. 79** E. Badian, ibid. 139-143** W. S. Watt, ibid. 167.
Cos. Suff. 45. Quaestor 60 or 58, in 60 if Cic. Fam. 15.21.2 refers to opposition to the attempt of Clodius to become a plebeian, but 58 if the consuls he opposed were Gabinius and Piso and the tribune was Clodius himself (see Shackleton Bailey, CLF 2.367, who favors 60). Mention of a colleague  suggests that he was one of the two quaestores urbani (ibid.).
On these tribunes, see now Gruen, Historia 15, 1966, 32-38. These lists are also based on the assumption that at the death of Saturninus the tribunicial elections had been held, and that the consular ones were interrupted by the murder of Memmius, perhaps after the election of M. Antonius who was said to be certain. Badian notes that in Rab. Perd. 26 Cicero does call him cos. desig.
Pr. 66? Aed. cur. 69. In MRR 2.132, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.418, no. 406. Praetor 66. In MRR 2.152, note that he may possibly be the praetorius Galba (RE no. 48) who was killed by mutinous troops of Caesar in 47 (Plut. Caes. 51.5** cf. Dio 42.52.2). See Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.289, on Att. 1.1.1** and below, on (Sulpicius) Galba, Pr. by 48.
Pr. by 58. The elderly L. Villius Annalis who was proscribed and killed in 43 is termed # by Appian (BC 4.18), but Appian must mean a man of praetorian rank, since his son, who was cognizant to the proceeding, was old enough to be a candidate for the quaestorship and was designated an aedile as a reward for his part in the matter (cf. Val. Max. 9.11.6). (TJC)
Senator, brother of the poet C, Lucilius. Use of the cognomen Hirrus by no. 25, below, Tr. pl. 53, a descendant of the senatorial brother of the poet, and its occurrence in the epigram from Corinth that mentions a Hirrus as legatus pro praetore in 102-100 (MRR 1.569) suggest the name given above for the poet's brother. See Cichorius, RS 67-70** MRR 1.570, note 7.
Pr. before 75. See MRR 2.115. This name in the SC de Oropiis (SIG? 747** Sherk RDGE 133-138, no. 23, 73 B.C.) should be deleted because it is composed of a repetition of the tribe of the previous name and the praenomen, nomen, and filiation of the following name, C. Licinius C. f. Ste. Sacerdos. See Mommsen, GS 5.496** Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 134-136.
Tr. pl. 131 or 130. See MRR 1.500501. Sumner (Orators 58) points out that while the lectio senatus in which Atinius had been passed over may be dated to 131, he was a colleague of C. Papirius Carbo in his tribunate, and should be dated with him in 130, against the evidence of Val. Max. 6.2.3 and in accord with the sequence of events in Liv. Per. 59.
Aed.? 88? It is uncertain to whom the aedileship of a Metellus Celer (Val. Max. 6.1.8) should be attributed (see MRR 2.41, 45, note 5, 144- and 539), but since the future consul of 60 (86) was very probably a tribune of the plebs in 68, and legatus of Pompey in 67, the earlier Metellus Celer is a better candidate (Sumner, Orators 132-133).
Pr. procos., uncertain date. Named in an inscription of Teanum Sidicinum, of late republican or early Augustan date (Eph. Epig. 8.217, no. 883** PIR P 10). Syme notes also ...cius Balbus (see MRR 2.483), a legatus named also in an inscription of Cos (Aepig. 1934, no. 85). Perhaps the same man** there is space for about eight letters. (RS, MS-RP 1.285)
Cos. 431. Diodorus (12.65.1) reports the praenomen as Gaius. The note in MRR 1.64 mistakenly states that the praenomen Gnaeus does not occur in the Iulian gens. Note the quaestor of 47, Cn. Iulius L. f., and see MRR 2.287, and the stemma in Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 264. The use of the praenomen Gnaeus in the Iulian gens remains doubtful.
Praetors by 82. See MRR 2.67. Sumner suggests that P. Magius (10), Tr. pl. 87 (MRR 2.47), colleague of M. Vergilius, may be one of the two sons of Minatus Magius of Aeclanum who became praetors before 81 when Sulla increased the number to eight (Vell. 2.16.3), and M. Magius Sarus, IIvir at Aeclanum (ILS 5318** ILLRP 523), may be the other (HSPh 74, 1968, 260-261).
Cos. 61. If he was the M. Valerius Messalla who received a nota from the censors and later became censor himself (Val. Max. 2.9.9), the date of the nota was probably 70 (Suolahti, Censors 478). He was praetor urbanus (ILS 46) and therefore praetor in 64 since Murena was pr. urbanus in 65 (MRR 2.158). See Sumner, Orators 130.
The praenomina were transposed in the Index (MRR 2.581) and are given correctly above. Q. Ligarius yielded his command to P. Attius Varus in 49 (Cic. Lig. 20** see MRR 2.260), and so had continued as legatus into that year. His status until his capture in 46 (Bell. Afr. 89.2** Schol. Gron. 291St) is not attested. (TJC) See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 118?RP 2.596.
Senator. An eques in 100 when he opposed Saturninus (Cic. Rab. Perd. 31** cf. Serv. ad Aen. 1.13), he became a senator later (Dio 37.26** cf. Auct. Vir. Ill. 73). Probably a tr. mil. in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo in 89 (see MRR 2.35, 38, note 15, 495** Cichorius, RS 151ff.** Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 116-117** Wiseman, NM 255, no. 353).[180]
Senator in 70. A juror in the trial of Verres (Cic. Verr. 1.30), he was a senator at the time, but as he was going to become a quaestor on December 5 of that year, he must have been one of Sulla?s appointees. See Schol. Gron. 337St and cf. Ps. Ascon. 216St. See also E. Gabba, Republican Rome 60-61, and 214, note 17** Nicolet, Ordre equestre 585.[200]
See MRR 2.93, 98. Quaestor in 76 (or 77?) with his brother-in-law Pompey in Spain (Cic. Balb. 5** cf. Sall. Hist. 2.56 and 57M) and was probably under attack at New Carthage. He fell in the battle at the Turia in 75 (or 76?) (Cic. Balb. 5** Plut. Sert. 21.2** Oros. 5.23.12). On the dates, see below, on Cn. Pompeiils Magnus (31) and Q. Sertorius (3).
Pliny includes him in a list of sudden deaths (NH 7.181), in a passage taken from Verrius Flaccus, after the names of two senators and before that of C. Aufustius, cum in senatum iret. Possibly father of M. Aemilius Q. f. M. n. Lepidus (72). Cos. 78, or a son of M. Aemilius M. f. Q. n. Lepidus (73), the IIIvir r. p. c. (RS, MS-RP 1.273-274).
Pr. 73. See MRR 2.110. Against Mènzer's perhaps (RE nos. 1 and 2) and Wiseman (NM 227, no. 140), Shackleton Bailey (Onom.) thinks it unlikely that a man who had obtained citizenship through a successful prosecution should have risen as far as the praetorship, or that, if he had, he would be described merely as pater huius equitis Romani (Cic. Balb. 53).
Senator? Asconius' remark (830 that C. Licinius Sacerdos (154), a candidate for the consulship of 63, was all but (tantum non) the first of his family to achieve a magistracy implies a previous senator of the name. See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 123** NM 237, no. 225. Cf. Cic. Cluent. 134** Val. Max. 4.1.10, for an equestrian ancestor in 142.
Pr. 49. Monetalis. In MRR 2.451, and Index, 612, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.439- 440, no. 412, 64 B.C. See L. R. Taylor, VDRR 251** Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 112-RP 2.590. On the question whether he is more properly termed legate or quaestor in 54 when he was with Caesar, see J. and A. Linderski, Phoenix 29, 1974, 214, note 15, probably a legatus.
Cos. Desig. 33. In MRR 2.329, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.486- 487, nos. 477-479, 45-44 B.C. Note his acclamation as imperator. In MRR 2.388, add the following: From the Pact of Puteoli in 39 until his death in 35, he could claim to be an augur and consul designate (ILS 8891-ILLRP 426, with the name Magnus Pompeius Magni f. Pius).
A friend of Catullus who saw service in Hisp. Cit. (Catull. 9.5ff.** 12.14ff.), and also under a Piso, probably Caesoninus, Cos. 58 and Procos. in Macedonia in 57-55 (28** 47). See Syme, Historia 5, 1956, 211ff.-RP 1.323** Class. et Mediaevalia 17, 1956, 129-134-RP 1.300-304. No evidence that either he or Catullus was an officer or magistrate.[217]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.455, and Index, 633, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.364-366, no. 350A, 86 B.C., with Gor[gonius] (4) and Ogulnius (1). Badian considers it probable that the name was Ver(ginius) (Studies 85, and 100, note 87). Crawford would identify him with M. Vergilius (4), Tr. pl. 87. See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 117-RP 2.595** Wiseman, NC 1964, 157.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.252, and Index, 617, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.327, no. 325, 101 B.C. Pr., uncertain date** probably between 93 and 89. In MRR 2.465, add ILLRP 485. See Syme, above, on no. 3** Wiseman, NM 260, no. 388. In 80 B.C. he is listed first among witnesses in a fragment  of an SC from Cormi in Lycia (TAM 2.3.899).
Legatus under Brutus in 42 (Plut. Brut. 51.2, Labeo** cf. 12.3, Labeo** App. BC 4.135, Labeo). In Gellius his name is given as Pacuvius Labeo (NA 5.21.10), which Badian (Salmon Studies 152-153) and Shackleton Bailey (Studies 103) accept as the proper form of his name: his son, M. Antistius Labeo, the jurist, had been adopted by an Antistius.
Honored as legatus pro praetore in an unpublished inscription of Cos, reported by Herzog, who suggested a date in the early first century. He might be a son of the consul of 139 (22) and father of Paulla Popillia (33), wife of the Cn. Piso (69), who is mentioned as a Catilinarian (MRR 2.159). See Mènzer, Klio 24, 1931, 338.[168x]
Envoy in 31. According to Porphyrio on Hor. Sat. 1.4.3, a Q. Varius, whom he confuses with Q. Varius Rufus, was sent by Octavian after the battle of Actium to put Cassius of Parma to death (cf. Veil. 2.87.3** Val. Max. 1.7.7). Possibly Q. Attius Varus (33) and the Q. Varus who was prefect of cavalry in 48 (MRR 2.283). (TJC)[215x]
Proq(uaestor) under Cn. Pompeius Magnus (32) in Spain (see MRR 2.298, and Crawford, RRC 1.480, no. 470, 46-45 B.C.). Probably the M. Minatius M. f. Porn. Sabinus who supervised the building of a tower and wall at Casilinum (not Tegianum) in Lucania (CIL 1_.2.1686-ILS 5321-ILLRP 395). See V. Bracco, MAL 1962, 432, note 9** Wiseman, NM 241, no. 256.
Cos. 192. Curule aedile 201. In the manuscript tradition the praenomen is given as T., not L., as Briscoe, Comm. Livy 65L, and Sumner, AJPh 96, 1975, 321-322, point out. It has regularly and rightly been corrected to L., since Titus competed for the consulship ex quaestura (Liv. 32.7.9). See Badian, JRS 61, 1971, 110-111.
Quaestor pro consule in Cyrene (Robinson, BMC Cat., Cyrenaica ccxxii-iii, who favors a date after Actium and before 27). G. Perl admits the possibility that Pupius was a quaestor before the triumviral period who gained full imperium in the absence, or upon the departure, of a praetorian governor, but prefers the later date (Klio 52, 1970, 349-351).
A senator named in the SC de Thisbensibus (SIG? 646-Sherk, RDGE no. 2, 26-31). Mommsen suggested that the mention of his tribe was a means of distinguishing him from the leading branch of the Acilii, the Glabriones (EE 1.288** see no. 36). He should be attributed to the Balbi, one of whom was consul in 150. (See L. R. Taylor, VDRR 185-186.)
Author of the Lex Aquilia de damno, of uncertain date (see V. Arangio-Ruiz, Storia di diritto romano 132** cited by G. Bagnani, Phoenix 6, 1952, 72). Berger (Encyclopedic Dictionary 547548) suggests the late third century, and A. Watson considers 287 (XII Tables 6). It was perhaps a tribunicial law (Niccolini, FTP 391, citing Inst. IV, 3, 15).
Procos. Macedonia 134-132? See MRR 1.489, 491. An inscription of Erythrae (IGRP 4.1537), though without title, probably refers to him. See now F. Schachermeyr and R. Merkelbach, Die Inschriften von Erythrae and Klazomenai (Bonn, 1972), no. 48, an inscription in his honor with his name in full** cf. IGRP 4.952** Tuchelt, Frèhe Denkmaler 145.
Tr. pl. 210. G. Bagnani (Phoenix 6, 1952, 73) points out that the Lex Atilia de tutore dando probably followed and supplemented the Lex Plaetoria de circumscriptione adulescentium, which is to be dated shortly before 191 (see also Berger, Encyclopedic Dict. 544** MRR 2.472). This law should be dated, not in 210, but ca. 190.[26x]
Quaestor and perhaps praetor of uncertain date in the late Republic. Despite the phrase quaestorius fuit nec ultra proficere voluit cum illi etiam Augustus consulatum offerret in Pomponius (Dig. 1.2.2.45), his refusal under the Triumvirs ut formulam componeret (Val. Max. 6.2.12), and the attribution to him of the iudicium Cascellianum (Gaius 4.166a, 169) suggest that he was urban praetor at some time under the triumvirate. (TJC)
Cos. 66. Wiseman remarks that this Volcacius can hardly be considered a novus homo in view of the long interval, which Cicero notes (Leg. Agr. 2.3), without novi before his own consulship. We must assume that some ancestors of this consul had senatorial rank (Wiseman, NM 276, no. 506). The name of the gens should be spelled Volcacius.
Praef. Class. 43. The officer in charge of part of Cassius' fleet is called Sextilius Rufus. He should more probably be identified with the officer L. Rufus (Dio 47.31.3** see MRR 2.356) than with C. Sextilius Rufus (23). In MRR 2.356, add the words rather than the quaestor in Cyprus, ca. 49, C. Sextilius Rufus (23).
As Sumner remarks (Orators 101), Cicero's references to a Q. Valerius of Sora, Brut. 169 and De Or. 3.43, hardly identify him with the tr. pl. in MRR 2.68. See now A. Keaveney, AC 51, 1982, 127- 128, who finds some confirmation in that Valerius's son did not suffer from the penalties Sulla imposed on the children of the proscribed.
Leg., lieut. under Lucullus in 73, see MRR 2.112. Thought to be a Cassius Barba (RE 29 a, Supb. 1.277), a name found among supporters of Caesar and M. Antonius in and after 45 (Cic. Att. 13.52.1** Phil. 5.18** 13.3). Shackleton Bailey, CLA 5.395, has suggested that the later Cassius Barba was a son of Lucullus' legatus** but see below, on Sornatius (1).
Legatus? or Prefect 87. See MRR 2.51, with the name P. Caelius. Change the name of this aged and ailing senator with a faithful dog to the one given above, and in MRR 2.51 add references to Plin. NH 8.144, Caelium senatorem** Plut. Soll. anim. 13.7, KA8oS** Aelian NA 7.10, #** see Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 134** Badian, Studies 90-96.
Cos. 64. Note the conjecture, based on the entry Caesare et Turmo in the Chronographer of 354, that he was a Minucius Thermus (60) who had been adopted by a Marcius Figulus and was really the Thermus named in Cic. Att. 1.1.2 as a likely candidate for the consulship of 64 (Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.292** Studies 121-122).
Leg., amb. 89-88 (see MRR 2.3536). Read as Manlius Maltinus, a name supported in a reading of one 11th cent. Ms of Iustin (38.3.4), and by the occurrence of the name at Interamna Praetuttianorum in an inscription of uncertain date (CIL 9.5073, Manlius Maltinus pr.). (LRT) See on T. Manlius Mancinus (61), MRR 2.39, note 19.
Cicero?s mention of the son of Acidirus in connection with the style of living that the younger Ca1purnius Bibulus, Valerius Messalla Corvinus, and the son of Cicero himself could keep up in Athens in 45 (Cic. Att. 12.32.2** cf. Fam. 4.12.2) suggests that his rank was comparable to that of their fathers. (TJC)[135x]
Quaestor of the consul L. Calpurnius Bestia in 111 (Sall. lug. 29.4-6** MRR 1.541, 543, note 4). He should more probably be identified with C. Sextius C. f. Calvinus (21), Pr. ca. 92 (see ILLRP 291** MRR 2.18) than with P. Sextius (9), who was convicted toward 90 of ambitus while pr. desig. (Cic. Brut. 180). See Sumner, Orators 76-77.[198x]
Legatus. With Verres in Sicily in 73 (Cic. Verr. 2.2.49), he remained with him, whether still a legate or not (see N. Marinone, AAT 100, 1965-1966, 219-252, esp. 241-246). He was a legatus in 71, and with Caesetius was in command of the fleet which captured (or found) the pirate ship (Cic. Verr. 2.5.63). See Wiseman, NM 263, no. 417.
Pr. 90. Quaestor 103 or 100. In MRR 2.576, refer also to Crawford, RRC 330-331, no. 330, 100 B.C.: coinage of Piso as quaestor along with Caepio for the purchase of grain. See RS, MS-RP 1.277. The date depends on that of the Lex frumentaria of Saturninus. See above, and Gruen, Historia 15, 1966, 44, note 72.
Cos. 35. Tr. pl. 43. His tribunate, like that of Agrippa, depends on Niccolini's view (FTP 355) that they were tribunes when Cornificius prosecuted Brutus and Agrippa Cassius. This is improbable, since the actions were apparently taken before a quaestio. See below, on Agrippa. Consul 35. In MRR 2.406, refer also to ILLRP 1271b.
Pr. before 100. His title is given as in SIG? 715 from Rhegium, which Dittenberger dates before 100 from the lettering. Perhaps identifiable with the Cn. Auf[idius . . . ] named in the SC de agro Pergameno in 129. See Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73. (RS, MS-RP 1.275** LRT) On the date, see M'. Aquillius (10) above.
In RE On nos. 7 and 50, Mènzer holds that the fine levied on M. Postumius (17), Tr. mil. c. p. 426, in 423 (Liv. 4.40.4 and 41.10) ended his public career and therefore precludes him from being identified with no. 50, above. On the trial and conviction, see Ogilvie, Comm. Livy 594-595.[174]
Leg. pro pr., uncertain date. He is named with this title in an inscription of Mevania (CIL 11.5029) of late republican or early Augustan date. He perhaps earned the gratitude of Mevania in the period of Caesar?s settlements of veterans (cf. Q. Valerius Orca, MRR 2.312) or under the triumvirate (RS, MS-RP 1.288).[181x]
Cos. 36. Pro quaestore pro praetore 41. In MRR 2.373, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.525, no. 517, 41 B.C. Proconsul 38. In MRR 2.392, note also an inscription of Ephesus, AEpig. 1968,  no. 480, in which he is honored by quei Ephesi | [negotiantur]** cf. nos. 485 and 486. In MRR 2, p. 392, read Teos, not Tenos.
Cicero implies that there were three Sasernae of about the same age in this period (Phil. 13.28), but only two were senators in 43. The tribune of the plebs in 44 (MRR 2.324) was more probably C. or P., as these were officers under Caesar in 46 (2.301). In MRR 2.324, delete the phrase or L. (TJC)
Monetalis. In MRR 2.450, and Index, 611, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.291, no. 267, 126 B.C. Against Sumner, who identifies the moneyer with the consul of 123 (Orators 68), Crawford (loc. cit.) suggests that he was a son of the consul of 123. See above, on L. Quinctius (42), on the symbols on the coins.
Pr. 42? A candidate for the praetorship of 42 (Cic. Fam. 11.16.3, 17.1), later referred to as a praetorius (Plin. NH 7.173** Val. Max. 1.8.12). On his aedileship in 45, see MRR 2.307** Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 361** S. Treggiari, Phoenix 27, 1973, 245253. Delete the notice of a praetorship in 43 in MRR 2.338. (RS, CP** TJC)
Delete the cognomen, for which there is no evidence since the gentilicium of the family of the mother of Augustus was Atius and the tribe of Aricia was Hor. not Ouf. (RS, CP). See MRR 2.35, 38, note 8** see also Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 18, 103-104, and H. B. Mattingly, Athenaeum 53, 1975, 262.
Cos. Desig. between 43 and 33. An augur, who committed suicide under pressure of threats from Octavian (Suet. Aug. 27.3, with the name Tedius Afer). Cf. CIL 14.3615-Inscr. Ital. 4.1.134, at Tibur, with the nomen Uttiedius, and the title augur. See Wiseman, NM 268, no. 454. Cf. MRR 2.446.[210x]
Tr. pl. 87. Badian (Studies 100, note 89) would prefer the variant name Verginius in the manuscript tradition of Cic. Brut. 179 and in Plut. Sulla 10.4. Wiseman, NM 272, no. 477, accepts Vergilius, and notes the name of C. Vergilius Balbus, Pr. 62 (see MRR 2.173, 181, 191, 198, 205, and cf. Cic. Prov. Cons. 7, C. Vergilius).
A senator who was refused permission to fight as a gladiator in Caesar's games in 46 (Dio 43.23.5, reading #, rather than # with Boissevain). Syme suggests that he may have been confused with Furius Leptinus (62), a man of praetorian stock, who according to Suetonius (Iul. 39.1) did so fight. (RS, MSRP 1.281-282)[95x]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.447, and Index, 595, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.277-278, no. 246, 133 B.C. He may be the C. Numitorius C. f. Lem. Named in the SC de agro Pergameno in 129 (but see L. R. Taylor, VDRR 238). Cf. Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73, and F. De Martino, PP, fasc. 10, 1983, 171-190, in favor of a date ca. 101.
Senator** see MRR 2.487. Shackleton Bailey has shown. that C. Albanius is the best attested spelling, both in the passages cited in MRR,, above, and in Cic. Att. 13.31.4 (CLF 2.173 and 461** Studies 6-7). See also Wiseman, NM 210, note 12. The name of Sestius? son should be read as L. Sestius P. f. Albanianus Quirinalis.[13x]
Grandfather of the jurist, perhaps a senator in the mid-second century. Note the contrast implied by Cic. Mur. 16: pater enim fuit equestri loco, avus nulla inlustri laude celebratus. (RS, MS-RP 1.289) His rank as senator, rejected by Nicolet, L'Ordre equestre 1028f., is defended by Shackleton Bailey, Onom.
Praef. eq. 51. See MRR 2.246. These three entries should be amalgamated under the name C. Volusenus Quadratus. Together they represent the long and excellent service of a notable equestrian officer (Syme, RR 70f., and 355). (RS, CP) In MRR 2.246  read Volusenus for Volusius. See also Suolahti, Junior Officers 398.
Listed in the consilium in the SC de agro Pergameno** see now Sherk, RDGE no. 12, 63-73. Delete the tribe Pup., in MRR 2.490 and the Index, 560. He may be identified as a son of no. 19, Cos. 162, and a brother of no. 20, Cos. 122. See MRR 1.496-497, note 1. On the date, see above, M.' Aquillius (10)
Monetalis. In MRR 2.439, and Index, 561, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.405-406, no. 391, 75 B.C. Probably a younger brother of the juror in the trial of Oppianicus (RE no. 2, above), and known to Cicero (Att. 13.34 and 45). See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 36** Syme, Historia 4, 1955, 61?RP 1.280-281.
Praetor 45? His praetorship in 45 is inferred from his proconsulate in Syria in 44 (MRR 2.307, 330), but should be queried (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 361). On his coins as imperator, see Crawford, RRC 1.519, no. 510, 42-41 B.C. On his offices, refer also to CIL 1_.796-ILS 885-ILLRP 444. See Wiseman, NM 263, no. 411.
Cos. 72. Pro consule ex praetura (Cic. Leg. 1.53), he was more probably governor of Asia than of Cilicia (MRR 2.15** Sumner, GRBS 19, 1978, 148** cf. Badian, Studies 87 and note 101). Cilicia was not yet a regularly organized province (Badian, loc. cit.** Sherwin-White, JRS 66, 1976, 1-14, esp. 5-8).
Cos. Suff.? 31. A senator, named in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 57, 71), probably the Cos. Buff. Of 31 (MRR 2.420). The tribe probably connects him with the Pompei Rufi (L. R. Taylor, VDRR 247** Reynolds, op. cit. 71** cf. Sumner, AJAH 2, 8-25, esp. 20-21).
His praenomen, given as M. due to the incorrect identification of Cicero's client with the M. Curtius whom Cicero recommended to Caesar for a military tribunate in 54 (QF 2.14.3** 3.1.10), is established as C. by that of his freedman C. Curtius Mithres (Fam. 13.69.1). See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 33- 34.
Monetalis. The date of his office as monetalis, previously taken to be 52 (MRR 2.435, and Index, 544) is put by Crawford in 63-62 (RRC 1.440, no. 413** cf. . C. D. Hamilton, TAPhA 100, 1969, 198). Possibly C. Cassius (59), the tyrannicide (Sumner, quoted by Badian, Phoenix 25, 1971, 141-142, note 37).[51x]
Leg., lieut. 45, ,43. See MRR 2.312, 354. One of three legates (not just two, as in Cic. Phil. 3.26) left behind in Africa by C. Calvisius Sabinus: Venuleius, Latinus (better Latinius, Shackleton Bailey), and Horatius (Cic. Fam. 12.30.7** and see Shackleton Bailey's comments, CLF 2.561** cf. Cic. Phil. 3.26).
Tr. pl. in 49. See MRR 2.258. Despite the claim in Schol. Bern. (ed. Usener, p. 97) that this Cotta was a tribune and colleague of Metellus, J. L. Ferrary holds that there was no such tribune and that Cotta was the senior senator and censorius L. Aurelius Cotta (102). Cos. 65 (Mel. Heurgon 1.285-292).
Leg., lieut. 77 or 76. He served under Pompey in Spain and was killed in the battle at Lauro, in 77 if Obsequens is right in dating it to the consuls of that year (Sall. Hist. 2.31M, from Schol. Bob. On Cic. Flacc. 14, p. 98St** Frontin. Str. 2.5.31, from Livy** Obsequens 58** cf. Plut. Sert. 18** App. BC 1.109).[116x]
Cos. 207. See MRR 1.274, 280, 284, note 4. It is almost a certainty that both Nero and his successor M. Iunius Silanus were sent to Spain (Nero in 211-210) with imperium pro consule. See Jashemski, Proconsular and Propraetorian Imperium 25f.** Sumner, Arethusa 3, 1970, 88, and 99, notes 37-40.
See MRR 2.246 and 359. As Shackleton Bailey points out, there is little evidence for identifying the praefectus fabrum of Ap. Claudius in 51 with the tr. pl. desig. for 42 (Cic. Ad Brut. 1.1** CQF/MB 238, ad loc.). Perhaps the Clodius Bithynicus who was in the following of L. Antonius at Perusia (App. BC 5.49).
Tr. mil.? 89 (see MRR 2.35). This is Cichorius' reading (RS 154f.)** but Bang read the fragments of the letters as M. FAB[I] M. F. [SE]R (CIL 6.37045-ILS 8888). The reading remains uncertain. (RS, CP) See now Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 19 and note 24, 121-123, who reads M. [M]aia[ni(us] M. [F., Se]r(gia Tribu).
See MRR 2.71. For discussions of his origin and command, see Wiseman, NM 210, no. 13. In MRR, for see below, Pontifices, read see below, note 8. On his name, see Shackleton Bailey, Studies 7. He is almost certainly the later Pontifex Minor (MRR 2.135, 137, note 12** and Shackleton Bailey, loc. cit.).
Leg., lieut. 44-43. A legatus who served with Dolabella and preceded him in Asia (Cic. Phil. 11.4). He was besieged along with Dolabella at Laodiceia of Syria and died there (App. BC 4.62, #** Dio 47.30.5, #). (RS, CP) In MRR 2.493, delete Octavius (34)** in 2.331, keep the above, and insert him in 2.354.
Tr. pl. 56. His RE number should probably be (2), since the L. Racilius in Cic. Verr. (2.2.31) could be the father of the tribune. He in turn was probably one of the conspirators against Q. Cassius Longinus in Spain in 48 (Bell. Alex. 52-55). (TJC) See Wiseman, NM 255, no. 354** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 63.
Cos. 57. Proconsul? 56. He probably held some provincial command after his praetorship in 60 (Cic. Att. 2.5.2, quoniam Nepos proficiscitur, April 14, 59). The provinces apparently available are Hisp. Ult., Sardinia and Corsica, Cyrene (improbable), and possibly Cilicia (RS, CP).
See MRR 2.37, 39, note 24, and Index, 582, on Lucanus, Leg., lieut. of Cosconius in 89 (Liv. Per. 75** see MRR 2.33, 36, 37, 39, notes 21 and 24). Cf. the consilium of Pompeius Strabo at Asculum: Cichorius, RS 171-172** Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 21, 158-159. See also Wiseman, NM 238, no. 232.
Cos. Suff.. 36 (MRR 2.399). He may possibly be identified with Q. Marcius Crispus (52), who refused to continue in service under Cassius when he surrendered his forces to him in 43 (MRR 2.347), or with L. (Marcius) Figulus (64), who was prefect of the fleet under Dolabella in that year (MRR 2.356).[137]
The praenomen depends on Willems? identification of the praef. Eq. With M. Pomponius (10), legate under Pompey in 67 (Senat 1.509, no. 277). In Appian Mith. 79 the readings vary between Pomponius and Pompeius, but Pomponius is sure in Plut. Luc. 15.2. (RS, CP)
Perhaps an officer in Caesar's guard when he set sentinels about Cicero's Puteolan villa on the occasion of Caesar's visit in December 45 (Cic. Att. 13.52.1). See also Phil. 13.3. (TJC) Lucullus' legate was perhaps his father (Shackleton Bailey, CLA 5.395), but see below on Sornatius (1).
Cos. 292, 276, 265. Cos. 292, Procos. 291. His consecration of Venus Obsequens (Serv. ad Aen. 1.720) may be dated to the time of his victory over the Samnites and his triumph as proconsul on Kal. Sext. in 291. See MRR 1.180-181, 182** L. Richardson, Jr., AJA 84, 1980, 58-59.
Aedile of the Plebs of uncertain date, who restored an early statue of the Sibyl near the Rostra (Plin. NH 34.22). Probably the tr. Pl. of 27, who devoted himself to Augustus (Macrob. Sat. 1.12.35-36** Dio 53.20.2-3), and carried the plebiscite to name the month Sextilis Augustus.
Senator, 55? Mènzer assumed that he was a senator on the uncertain ground that he knew of Cato's proposal in the Senate that Caesar should be delivered over to the Usipetes and Tencteri for his breach of the sacred law regarding legates (Plut. Caes. 22.3** cf. Cat. Min. 51.1-2** App. Celt. frag. 18).
Cos. 90. In MRR 2.442, for (143), read (142), and for Cos. 64, read Cos. 90. Refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.325, no. 320, 103 B.C. In the Index, MRR 2.575, note the monetalis under RE no. 142, adding Crawford's dating, and delete this entry under RE no. (143). Cos. 64.[109x]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.436, and Index, 550, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.413, no. 403, ca. 70. Wiseman suggests that he was a Cordius, an attested nomen, or that Cordus was a cognomen (NM 226, no. 134), and Crawford that the monetalis was a Mucius Scaevola recalling the cognomen of an earlier Mucius.
Cos. 174. Mènzer (49) suggests that he was one of the unknown curule aediles of 185, elected when Sp. Postumius (44). Cos. 186, held the elections. This is consistent with a praetorship in 183 (MRR 1.379). See Plin. NH 18.41-43. There is no other ancient evidence.
Legatus of Brutus, 43-42. See MRR 2.354, 366, and on his coinage, Crawford, RRC 1.517, no. 506, 43-42 B.C. If he is a son of the Pedanius in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo in 89, his name may be restored as above. See Cichorius, RS 174** Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 162-164.
whom he dates to 147 (RRC 1.256, no. 217), but favors considering the monetalis to be a son of the senator. See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 125, esp. note 4.
The quaestor of 45 and proquaestor in Asia in 44 (see MRR 2.308, 327) may be a brother of Sex. Appuleius (16a), q., pr. urb., and flam. Iulialis in the late Republic (MRR 2.462, 474, 486), and so not the consul of 20, but his uncle (see Sumner's stemma in Phoenix 25, 1971, 362).
Praetor urbanus? 76? On the possibility that the author of the Interdictum Salvianum, which regulated pledges by coloni, was a praetor urbanus of about 76, see B. W. Frier, TAPhA 113, 1983, 224, 229** ZRG 96, 1979, 204-228, esp. 220-223** and Landlords and Tenants in Imperial Rome 107, note 118.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.454, and Index, 626, delete this entry. Mommsen and Grueber had identified this moneyer with L. Titurius Sabinus (2) above, and Crawford, RRC 1.547, note 10, remarks that these forms arise from an erroneous reading of his coins.
Tr. pl. 53. Shackleton Bailey (CLA, 4.342, on Att. 8.11A) notes that he is not listed among the five senators** that Caesar captured at Corfinium (BC 1.23.2), and so had probably succeeded in escaping before the town was taken. The full name as above is given in Cic. Fam. 8.8.5.
The officer sent in advance by Cato to Cyprus in 58 to take charge of the royal treasure and warn King Ptolemy not to fight (Plut. Cat. Min. 35.1, 37.1-3** Brut. 3). The suggestion that in view of his financial responsibilities he was a quaestor is made both in RE and by Wiseman (CQ 14, 1964, 123).
Praetor of uncertain date but as addressee of the autobiography of M. Aemilius Scaurus should be dated to the late second or early first century (Plin. NH 33.21** Wiseman, NM 232, no. 183** Sumner, Orators 70). Perhaps identifiable with RE no. 4, but more probably his father. See MRR 2.76 and 81.
Tr. pl. See MRR 1.540. If he was removed from the Senate by the censors of 115 at the same time as C. Licinius Geta (Liv. Per. 62), as suggested by Sumner (Orators 75, see the stemma, 76), his tribunate may be dated closely with that of L. Calpurnius Bestia (23) to ca. 120 (MRR 1.524).
Cos. 471, 468, 465, 443, 439. The term pro consule (MRR 1.34, 464 B.C.), strange for this period, is taken by Sherwin-White (Roman Citizenship) 25) to refer to a federal, not a Roman, command. See also the note in Ogilvie, Comm. Livy 464-466.
Honored as a patron at Magnesia on the Maeander (L Magn. 143), and at Caunus along with his brother Aulus (G. E. Bean, JHS 74, 1954, 90, no. 26-AEpig. 1957, 165). Probably sons of the consul of 60, but not specifically termed magistrates or senators: See Wiseman, NM 210, no. 9.
Cos. 162, 155. Censor 159. In MRR 1.445-446, refer also to Plin. NH 34.30, dated to 158. He also built a porticus in the Area Capitolina (Veil. 2.1.2). Pontifex. Pont. max. in 150 (MRR 1.457), he had certainly become a pontifex some time before.
Cos. 139. The M. Popillius M. f. Laenas who was honored as a legatus by Magnesia on the Maeander (I. Magn. 114, no. 123) may be identified with the future consul of 139. His mission and his date remain uncertain, but he was with Metellus Macedonicus in Greece in 146 (MRR 1.468).
Cos. 205, 194. Leg., lieut. 190. In MRR 1.358, refer also to Liv. 38.53.10, and 58.9, and cf. 48.7, and 51.3** Per. 37** App. Syr. 21** Diod. 29.5, 8, and 10. Cos. 205, In MRR 1.301, refer also to Liv. 28.38.6. See also Balsdon, Historia 21, 1972, 224-234.
Q(uaestor). Against Grueber (see MRR 2.13, 99 to 94 B.C.), Crawford dates his coins as quaestor to 113 or 112 (RRC 1.308, no. 295), and for his connections refers to the stemma prepared by J. F. Mitchell, Historia 15, 1966, 31, who, however, dates the quaestorship to 96.
Cos. suff. 33. Monetalis. In MRR 2.455, and Index, 635, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.457, no. 436, 52 B.C. He was proconsul of Asia, perhaps in 28-27 (Syme, Historia 11, 1962, 147148-RP 2.532). See Wiseman, NM 274, no. 494. He was tribune of the plebs in 51 (MRR 2.241). (TJC)
Cos. 262, Cens. 253. Under RE no. 56 (cf. 48) Mènzer holds, on the strength of Fast. Hyd. and Chr. Pasc., that the cognomen Albinus was in the name and preceded Megellus. It does not appear in Fast. Cap., which are preserved entire for the years 262 and 253.
A senator, who was so injured in riots before Cicero's exile that he lost his life (Cic. Mil. 37). In Ascon. 32C, a report that he appeared in the disorders attending the death of Clodius is rightly rejected and the phrase inter quos C. Vibienus senator removed from the text (line 24).
Leg., amb. 145. Add as no. c in MRR 1.470. He was present as a Roman legate at the struggle and the settlement that attended the death of Ptolemy VI Philometor and the succession of Ptolemy VII Euergetes II (Physcon) (Joseph. Contra Apion 2.49-51** cf. Iustin. 38.8.2-4).
A partisan of Mark Antony, listed among other distinguished men, who died with his son after Actium (Dio 51.2.5-6** but cf. Suetonius [Aug. 13.2], who, without naming the victims, reverses the order  of their deaths and dates them after Philippi). See PIR_ 1.193, no. 989. (TJC)
Almost certainly a military tribune in the consilium of L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus (217). Cos. 49, in Asia in 49, since he is named in Josephus' list (AJ 14.229, 238) between two military tribunes so specifically termed (J. Suolahti, Arctos 2, 1958, 152-166).[58x]
Senator 82. Put to death at Sulfa?s command along with Venuleius (Oros. 5.21.8, P. Laetorius** Flor. 2.9.26, without the praenomen** Val. Max. 9.2.1, M. Plaetorius). Mènzer distinguishes him from the M. Laetorius who fled into exile with Marius in 88 (App. BC 1.60). See MRR 2.494.
Pr. 81, procos. in Cilicia 80-79. See MRR 2.76, 80, 84. On his return he was prosecuted by M. Aemilius Scaurus, the younger, and condemned. See Badian, PBSR 33, 1965, 48-51, with his probable filiation. See also Cic. Scaur. 45-46** Ascon. 16C, 74C.
Cos. 77. Praetor by 80. See MRR 2.80. Noting the age of his father, Brutus Callaicus (57). Cos. 138, Sumner suggests that his career, as in many other cases, was delayed during the wars, so that the praetorship should probably be dated before 90 (Orators 103-104).
Tr. pl. 88. On his family and his plebeian status, see Shackleton Bailey, Studies 131- 132, and Onom. ** H. B. Mattingly (above, no. 60)** P. B. Harvey, rev. of Shackleton Bailey, Studies, AJPh 101, 1980, 119. In MRR 2.42-43, refer also to Cic. Har. Resp. 43-44** Ascon. 80C.
Tr. pl. 43. See MRR 2.340, and correct May 9 to April 9. Refer also to Cic. Ad Brut. 2.2. Shackleton Bailey would identify the Titius of Fam. 10.21.3 with L. Titius, brother-in-law of Plancus and father of the consul of 31 (CLF 2.563). See also Bengtson, ANRW 1.1, 1972, 967-981.
Cos. 117. Augur. Scaevola augur was still alive and able to oppose Sulla in the Senate in 88 (Val. Max. 3.8.5), but died not long afterwards, probably early in 87 (Cic. Lael. 1). In the list in MRR 1.496, and in the Index, 2.593, read ?Augur before 129?ca. 87.?
He is known only with the title # in an inscription of Messenia (IG 5.1.1432). If he was a governor of the Macedonian province, he should be placed between C. Memmius and T. Didius, therefore probably in 102 (Sumner, Orators 89** MRR 1.564, 103 B.C.). See above, on C. Memmius (5 and 3).
Cos. 21. In MRR 2, Index, p. 527, read XV vir s. f., not X vir. His filiation was M'. f., and he may perhaps be identified with the Barbula named in App. BC 4.49 (Borghesi 5.289ff.). (TJC) There is no sign that the cognomen Barbula was included in Fast. Cap. for 21.
In MRR 2.442, 31 B.C., refer, on his coins, also to Crawford, RRC 1.542-543, no. 546, 31 B.C. Acclaimed imperator when serving first under Antony and then under Octavian, in the Cyrenaica. See G. Perl, Klio 52, 1970, 319-354, esp. 352-353** 53, 1971, 369-379, esp. 378.
Leg., lieut. ? See MRR 2.14, 16, note 2. As the sources give him no title, and as the proconsuls Didius and Crassus in Spain in 94, the year of the notice about him in Obsequens 51, are known, Sumner suggests that he was a legatus (Orators 74).
Cos. 461. For discussion whether his praenomen was Ser. or P. see MRR 1.43, note 2, cf. 1.36** Mènzer, RE no. 36** Ogilvie, Comm. Liv. 415, who holds that he was the envoy of 449 (see MRR 1.49** Liv. 3.50.15-16** Ascon. 77C).
Senator. See MRR 2.495. Probably a praetorius by 129, as he is listed third in the large consilium in the SC de agro Pergameno (Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73). On his adoption of a Calpurnius Piso, see Cicero Dom. 35. On the date, see M?. Aquillius (10), above.[176]
Cos. 176. Mention of a Cn. Cornelius, probably the above, in M. Guarducci, I. Cret. 2.3.5, suggests that he should be included in 190 B.C., in MRR 1.358-359, as one of the junior officers with the consul L. Scipio in Greece and Asia.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.431, and Index, 526, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.305, no. 291, 114 or 113 B.C. Crawford suggests that he was father of no. 62, the consul of 66 B.C., and perhaps the son of the consul of 126. See also M. Stuart, AJA 49, 1945, 226-251.
Q(uaestor?). In MRR 2.436, and Index, 548, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.331, no. 332, 98 B.C. Both Crawford and Wiseman distinguish between two Cloelii, the second one probably being the Marian legatus of 83, and quaestor ca. 95 (Wiseman, CR 17, 1967, 263-264).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.441, substitute Gar(gonius) for Gar(gilius), and both there and in the Index, 570, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.364-366, no. 350A, 86 B.C. On Gargonius, see Cicero, Brut. 180** Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 117-RP 2.595** Wiseman, NM 233, no. 193, with a query.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.447, and Index, 592, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.324, no. 319, 103 B.C. Perhaps the quaestor in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo at Asculum (Crawford loc. Cit.** Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 18, 101-102). Cf. MRR 2.56, 86 B.C.[144x]
Senator before 46. He had received his rank from Caesar before 46, when Metellus Scipio put his sons to death (Bell. Afr. 28.2, quorum patrem Caesar in senatum legerat** cf. Bell. Alex. 57.1). Probably from Spain, as his sons are called duo Titii Hispani. (RS, MS-RP 1.290)
Tr. mil.? Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 131, notes that he was not certainly a tr. mil. in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo (see MRR 2.35), and that Cichorius identifies him with the Aeb]utius (above) named in Gran. Lic. See Criniti, L epigrafe di Asculum 117-119.
Cos. 40. Tr. pl. 47. Delete the query in MRR 2.287. His tribunate is not expressly named, but his activity with Trebellius against Dolabella implies it clearly (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 260- 262). Consul 40. See below, on Cn. Domitius Calvinus, Cos. 53, 40.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.436, and Index, 549, refer to Crawford, RRC 1.229-230, no. 173, 169-158 B.C. Perhaps a son of C. Cluvius Saxula (14), Pr. 173. See also on Sax(ula?), Crawford, RRC 1.233-234, no. 180, 169-158 B.C., perhaps a younger brother of the above.
His quaestorship, held before being Xvir stlit. Iudic. Ex S. C., and Ivvir cap. Ex S. C., and the tr. Pl., aed. cur., all held before 23, suggest that at least he was quaestor before 31 (CIL 9.2845-ILS 915** Wiseman, NM 249, no. 308). See De Laet, 69, no. 279.
He very probably had been praetor by 59, since his service as Caesar's legatus pro praetore was continuous from 58 to 50 (MRR), and in that year Caesar stationed him in Cisalpine Gaul quo maiore commendatione conciliaretur ad consulatus petitionem (Hirtius in BG 8.52.2).
Mènzer (Caninius 14) suggests the cognomen Sallustianus. As he was a proquaestor in 50 he may very well have been quaestor in 51. (TJC) See Syme, Sallust 11, note 20** Wiseman, NM 258, no. 371.
Served under Q. Caecilius Metellus (87), probably as quaestor or legatus, in 68- 67 (Cic. Planc. 27, no title preserved). See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 156-166, esp. 160-161-RP 2.605-616, esp. 610. Listed wrongly in RE as Cn. (Appuleius) Saturninus, no. 27.
Cos. 170. In MRR 1.350, add that his province was Fleet and Macedonia. In MRR 1.353, he is described as praefectus Romanae classis (Liv. 36.20.7), but is perhaps mistakenly termed legatus in 36.12.9. See below, on A. Postumius Albinus Luscus (46).
Leg., Lieut. 54. In MRR 2.225, add a reference to Athenaeus 6.273 b (#).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.437, and Index, 557, refer also to Crawford RRC 1.318-319, no. 310, 118107 B.C. Crawford distinguishes between the monetalis and the praetor and proconsul of the same name in 119 and 118 (MRR 1.526, 528), who is also RE no. 373.
A refugee from the proscriptions who became an officer under Sextus Pompeius (App. BC 4.43, and 84) in 42. In MRR 2.362, on Pompeius Bithynicus (26), note that the reading in App. BC 4.43, and 84 (#) should be retained. There is no evidence that this Hirtius was a senator.
Senator in 90. He held in his ergastulum in the Ager Gallicus the young M. Aurius of Larinum, who had been captured in the Social War (Cic. Cluent. 21, qui inter sicarios damnatus est). The praenomen shows that he did not belong to the patrician line. (RS, MS-RP 1.288)
Senator in 39. A probable supplement in line 7 of the SC de Aphrodisiensibus (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 57 and 69). Cf. Syme, Historia 4, 1955, 66, on gentes that use the cognomen Plautus. Note the L. Sergius in Cic. Dom. 13.[192]
A senator of uncertain date, probably early first century. His accuser, L. Cossinius of Tibur, won Roman citizenship by his condemnation, and Cossinius' son was a prominent equestrian contemporary of Cicero (Cic. Balb. 53). See Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 493.[43]
IIIvir. CIL 1_.2.802?ILS 2994-ILLRP 187: [D]iovei victore | T. Mefu [ . . . ] M. f. | IIIvir [resti]tuit. An early date. The name is probably Mefulanus, formed like Mevulanus. Such a commission for restoring buildings is recorded in Livy (25.7.5-6, without names). (RS, CP)
Cos. 131. Sumner (Orators 52) notes that election as quaestor in 152 for office in 151 may be the meaning of Val. Max. 2.2.1. Aedile 142? See MRR 1.475, 476, note 2. It could be dated within the period up to 137 (Sumner, loc. cit.).
Officer under Licinius Nerva in Sicily, 104. A. Roes and W. Vollgraf identify the cantharos of Stevensweert as booty from this Sicilian war, and refer the inscription on it (M. Titini) to this officer (Mon. et Mem. Fondation Piot 46, 1952,61-67-AEpig. 1953, no. 156
In MRR 2.307, delete the name of the Caecilius listed as a tribune of the plebs in 45. He was apparently an architect and in any case had first seen Rome less than two years before (Shackleton Bailey, CLA 5.381** cf. Att. 13.20, 33a.4, and 35.1).
Pr. 44. See MRR 2.322. The choice of possible gentilicia is very wide. See however Wiseman, NM 281, no. 543, who suggests Sextius, probably the Sextius who conspired against Caesar (App. BC 2.113), and the former guaestor in Sicily (MRR 2.478).
Proconsul in Hisp. Ult. See MRR 1.464. His arrival and initial success may be dated to 147.[218] Orosius (5.4.1-2) places his defeat and death in 146, but before the arrival of his successor, C. Plautius Hypsaeus (9). See R. C. Knapp, Aspects 30** Simon, Kriege 87-92.
Cos. suff. 162. In MRR 1.422, add, with a query, a reference to a milestone near Venafro, CIL 1_.2.822-ILLRP 460. Monetalis. In MRR 2.438, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.218, no. 147, 189-180 B.C., who identifies him with the consul of 162.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.444, and Index, 584, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.216, no. 143, 189- 190 B.C. Crawford suggests that he was no. 14, Q. Maenius, Pr. 170, rather than no. 12, P. Maenius (as in MRR 2.444), which was already doubted by Mommsen-Blacas. See below.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.455, and Index, 634, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.346-351, no. 342, 90 B.C. He was probably the adoptive father of the consul of 43 (see below, no. 16). See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 131** NM 274, no. 490** Rowland, TAPhA 97, 1966, 409-410.
Tr. Pl. 68. His cognomen was almost certainly Restio (Macrob. Sat. 3.17.13** cf. Gell. NA 2.24.13). (TJC) On the moneyer C. Antius Restio see Crawford, RRC 1.470, no. 455, but his date is 47. On the tribune, see Syme, ?Ten Tribunes,? JRS 53, 1963, 55-60-RP 2.557-565.
In the consilium of L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus (218). Cos. 49, in Asia in 49 (Joseph. AJ 14.229, 238), probably as a Leg., lieut., as he is listed first after T. Ampius Balbus (J. Suolahti, Arctos 2, 1958, 152-163** cf. MRR 2.266).
Aed. cur., uncertain date. He put on a revival performance of the Andria of Terence (J. Heurgon, REL 27, 1949, 106-108). See the text and apparatus of Donatus, Commentum Terenti (ed. Wessner) 1, p. 36, on the Didascalia to the Andria, Praefatio 6.
Leg., envoy 41. He may well be the Caecina quidam Volaterranus who came to Cicero as Octavian's agent in the autumn of 44 (Cic. Att. 16.8.1** Syme, RR 131, 208). The L. Caecina L. f. suggested in MRR 2.376 may be later (RS, CP). See also Wiseman, NM 218, nos. 74, 75.
Cos. 171. See MRR 1.416. On his march into Illyria, add Livy 43.5.1-10, and see M. G. Morgan for the possibility that he had passed through the Transalpine Iapodes to the Segestani before being recalled to Italy (Historia 23, 1974, 188-189).
A brother of Q. Curtius Salassus, probably an officer under Cn. Pompeius (32) in Spain in 45 when he plotted to capture his commander and bring him to Caesar. He was discovered and put to death (Cic. Fam. 6.18.2** on the cognomen, see CIL 9.326, 327).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.448, and Index, 602, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.468, no. 453, 47 B.C. He is addressed by Cicero (Att. 16.16A and B) in 44 as praetor designatus (cf. MRR 2.339). See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 124.[158x]
Senator in 43 (Cic. Phil. 13.28). An unattested nomen. Syme notes cases of Albisius and one example of Albidius (RS, MS-RP 1.274). Albedius is read in three of the manuscripts. See also Shackleton Bailey, Studies 6** and Wiseman, NM 210, no. 11.
The officer (leg., lieut.?) under Sertorius in 76 (MRR 2.95) is perhaps to be identified with the young member (no. 40) of the consilium of Pompeius Strabo in 89, L. Insteius L. f. Fal. (Cichorius, RS 167** see Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 21, 150-151). (LRT)
Senator in 129 (MRR 2.497** Sherk, RDGE 63-73, no. 12). Being sixth in order in the list of the consilium, he was probably of praetorian rank. See Syme, Historia 5, 1956, 206-RP 2.318. On possible datings, see above, on M'. Aquillius , (10).
Cos. 469. Mènzer and Gundel both hold that the cognomen Tricostus was probably included in the Capitoline Fasti. There is no trace of it, although the nomenclature of the gens is much in favor of it. See Degrassi, Inscr. It. 13.1.91, 3581
Senator, probably of the late second century. As T. Coponius of Tibur gained Roman citizenship by securing his condemnation he was very probably a senator (Cic. Balb. 53). See Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 493** M. C. Alexander, CPh 80, 1985, 20-32.[154]
Tr. Mil., Aed. pl., Q. Iud., Cur. Fru. (ILS 907-CIL 6.1480, 1481). Possibly, but not certainly, a senator by 31. Cf. CIL 11.2526-6.39770. See Suolahti, Junior Officers 316, 406** De Laet no. 278. (TJC, LRT)
Tr. pl. 91 or 90? For arguments based on Cic. Brut. 182, and 222 (ex accusatione M. Aquili diligentiae fructum ceperat) suggesting that, like his associates, he was a tribune of the plebs, see Sumner, AJPh 84, 1963, 350, note 57** cf. Gruen, RPCC 195, note 30.
As a legatus in Gaul in 53-51 (MRR 2.232, 239, 245), he probably was a quaestor by 54. His praetorship in 45 is inferred from his command in Africa Nova in 44 (MRR 2.330** see Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 360-361** Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 130-131** NM 261, no. 402).
Interlocutor in Cicero's ND (1.15), and perhaps a senator since he is grouped in a dialogue attributed to 76 with C. Aurelius Cotta (75) and C. Velleius, who is designated a senator Perhaps one of the duo Balbi of De Or. 3.78 (RS, MS-RP 1.283-284).
Promagistrate in Sicily, 132. On the Elogium found at Tarquinii (MRR 1.498-499, note 2), see J. Heurgon, who rejects Degrassi?s suggestion and would refer the Elogium to a local magistrate of Tarquinii of much earlier date (MEFR 63, 1951, 119-137).
Cos. 237, 224, 212, 209. Proconsul 211 (MRR 1.274). Note that when he was summoned to Rome because of Hannibal's march on Rome he received a special grant of imperium within the city, ut par cum consulibus imperium esset (Liv. 26.9.10).
Senator? He is cited by his son, an interlocutor in Cic. ND, regarding a session of the Senate in 162 and the double sun in 129 (2.11 and 14, and notes in Pease's edition). Probably a senator (RS, MS-RP 1.283-284, against Mènzer, RE no. 18).
Leg., lieut.? No title preserved. See MRR 2.352. Nephew of C. Cassius Longinus (59). Complete the name in MRR 2.352 in 43 and add it in 2.364, in 42 B.C., and the Index, 543. Refer also to App. BC 4.135, on his suicide after Philippi.[50]
Senator in 74, juror in the trial of Oppianicus (Cic. Cluent. 107). Mènzer suggested that these two were really one person** so, too, Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 124, both agreeing that L. is the correct praenomen. See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 56.[151]
Cos. 135. In MRR 1.488-489, the invaders who were attacked by the consul should be called Ardeii and Palarii as in App. Illyr. 10 (M. G. Morgan, Athenaeum 49, 1971, 255). In MRR 1.488-489, refer also to CIL 1_.2.635-ILS 22-ILLRP 332.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.445, and Index, 588, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.357- 361, no. 346, 88 B.C. A Marian, he died a legate in 82, in the struggle against Sulla. See T. J. Luce, AJA 72, 1968, 29-30, 33, on his career** Sumner, Orators 127.
This man of Minturnae, apparently a relative of Q. Titinius, a juror in the trial of Verres (Cic. Verr. 2.1.128), may also have been a senator, but can hardly have been the monetalis (6, above). See Plut. Mar. 38.3-4** Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 141.
Cos. 49. If, as Sumner suggests, he was a younger brother of Lentulus Spinther (238). Cos. 57, his filiation should be P. f. L. n. (Orators 140-144)** cf. T. P. Wiseman, JRS 65, 1975, 168. See below, on Lentulus Spinther.
See MRR 2.484, and now ILLRP 302. Mommsen (CIL 1_.2.398) thought him a prefect like those sent to Capua and Cumae, but Tibiletti suggests that he was like the prefects often left by a commander in charge of a town (RIL 86, 1953, 82).
Quaestor 43. Sex. Titius is a frequent and probable emendation for the name as given in Cic. Phil. 13.28** cf. 6.10** see Sex. Titius (24), below** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 36-37. Note however the name Tittius in ILS 3397, and in IGRP 1.1024: #. (TJC, LRT)
E. Badian identifies the quaestor of M. Antonius in 102-100 (MRR 1.572) with the legate of 89 (MRR 2.36) and suggests that he had held the praetorship in the meantime (Philologus 103, 1959, 86-87). See also C. Nicolet et al., Insula sacra 50.
Leg., lieut. under M. Antonius (Creticus) in 74. See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 119-RP 2. 597-598** Wiseman, NM 239-240, no. 245, both with examples of the occurrence of the word as a gentilicium, but agreement that it could be simply a praenomen.[134]
Monetalis. See Crawford, RRC 1.261, no. 225, 141 B.C. Perhaps the Nomentanus who was on the staff of Scaevola in Asia in 120 (MRR 1.524), and whose name may be restored in Lucilius 56M and 69M. See Wiseman, NM 216, no. 55.
Praetor 44. See MRR 2.322. Several nomina are possible (TJC). For the suggestion of Voconius or, more probably, Sextius, one of the conspirators against Caesar, see Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 497. See also Wiseman, NM 281, no. 543.
Cos. 264. See MRR 1.202-203. Note the inscription found at S. Omobono in Rome recording his donarium from the spoils of Volsinii (J. M. Reynolds, JRS 61, 1971, 138, with M. Torelli?s reading, and the bibliography cited there).[94]
In MRR 2.431, read Safra as a cognomen since there is no period between S and A. See Crawford, RRC 1.251, no. 206, 150 B.C. In MRR add this to the text and transfer the entry to its alphabetic place in 2.451, and in the Index from 2.528 to 2.615.
Pr. 105? Propr. Sardinia 104? See MRR 1.556, 560. Refer also to Lucilius (88-91M). Gruen suggests the dates 107 and 106, resp., for his two offices. See Wiseman, NM 210-211, no. 16, and Badian, Klio 66, 1984, 306-307** Gruen, TAPhA 95, 1964, 101-106.
Praetor 69. See MRR 2.132. He was praetor urbanus, since he granted the interdict de vi hominibus armatis to Caecina (Cic. Caec. 23** and for evidence also favoring 69 over 68 as the date, see B. W. Frier, TAPhA 113, 1983, 225-227).
Senator ca. 75-70. See MRR 2.493, but correct Verr. 2.1.26 to 2.1.126. On the relation of him and his family with the Lucilii Gamalae of Ostia, see M. Cebeillac, Akten des Vl. Internaz. Kongresses gr. U. lat. Epig. 457-462** MEFR 85, 1973, 517ff.
Leg., lieut. 87. See MRR 2.51. Badian suggests that he was more probably A. Plotius (7). Leg., lieut. 90 (2.29) than M. Plautius Silvanus (29). Tr. Pl. 89 or 88. According to Livy (Per. 80), he was defeated by Samnite forces (misreported in MRR 2.51).
According to J. Suolahti, his rank in the consilium of P. Cornelius Lentulus Crus (218). Cos. 49, in Asia, as reported by Josephus (AJ 14.229, 238), was probably that of leg., lieut. or quaestor (Arctos 2, 1958, 152-163** cf. MRR 2.256).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.448, and Index, 600, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.497-498, no. 487, 43 B.C. The legend S. F. on the coins may signify that he was a Xvvir s. f. See Porph. Ad Hor. Sat. 1.4.93- 94, 10.26-27** Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 124.
Quaestor or Proquaestor 48. The man who buried Pompey the Great in Egypt (Auct. Vir. Ill. 77. 12, Servius Cordus** Lucan 8.715-717, . . . Cordus. / Quaestor ab Icario Cinyreae litore Cypri / infaustus Magni fuerat comes.). (RS, MS-RP 1.288-289)
Perhaps a senator (App. BC 5.49)** put to death along with Cannutius after the capture of Perugia in 40. Identified by Gardthausen (Augustus 2.1.98, note 21) with C. Flavius Hemicillus (11) (see above), but he probably died at Philippi. (TJC)[91]
He was expelled by the censors from the Senate in 174 (Liv. 41.27.2, with praenomen L.** Vell. 1.10.6, with praenomen Cn.** Val. Max. 2.7.5, with L.** Frontin. Str. 4.1.32, no praenomen). On the identification, see MRR 1.391, note 3.
Senator in 39, listed in the commission in the SC de Aphrodisiensibus (J. M. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome 71). Badian suggests emending the name to (E)HO1OE, and that he was a younger brother of C. Hedius C. f. Thorus (ZPE 55, 1984, 111).
See MRR 2.287. Sumner accepts his quaestorship, in either 47 or 46 (Phoenix 25, 1971, 263-264), and from his praenomen suggests that he was a third son of the consul of 64. Cf. below, on Cn. Iuli(us) L. f. (Caesar?).
He subdued the Treveri just after Actium (Dio 51.20.5** Syme, RR 302, note 5), and was acclaimed Imp. A VIIvir Epulonum before 12 (M. W. H. Lewis, Official Priests, 57, 93, 169** Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 124** NM 245, no. 276).
Probably a senator in 44 as he took part in the assassination of Caesar (App. BC 5.4). Petrucidius M. f. (Petrosidius 2), Legatus of Cn. Pompeius the younger in Spain in 45 (MRR 2.312** cf. ILLRP 1172** Aepig. 1952, 111** Wiseman, NM 250, no. 316).
Senator by 140. See SIG? 674** MRR 2.496. Badian suggests that he was an Asellio, PACA 11, 1968, 1-2. See Sherk, RDGE no. 9, pp. 49-53. In view of the known tribe of other Sempronii, the reading in SIG? 674 is more probably # than #.
Pr. 66. See above, on Cassius (13). It remains uncertain whether the monetalis of 78 (Crawford, RRC 1.403, no. 386) may be identified with the praetor of 66 (MRR 2.152) and candidate for the consulship of 63 (Ascon. 92C** Comm. Pet. 7).
Tr. pl. and legatus. In MRR 2.468 and 482 spell his name as Coelius. See Syme, JRS 53, 1963, 55RP 2.557-558** Wiseman, NM 225, no. 128** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 28, and Onom. Latiniensis may mean ?of the Ager Latiniensis.?
See MRR 2.332, 44 B.C., Special Commissions, no. 2. Cicero calls him Nucula (Phil. 12.20)but the name appears as a cognomen in CIL 6.38676: L. Numisius A. f. Tro. Nucula. See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 120-RP 2.598** and Mènzer, RE 17.1238f.
Aed. pl. 65. In MRR 2.158, refer also to Cic. Att. 1.1.3. Procos. Asia 61-58. He was honored at Claros (Bull. Epig. 1958, no. 390** cf. AJA 62, 1958, 98** and on honors to him and others of the family at Samos, Bull. Epig. 1958, no. 390).
Monetalis. Crawford (RRC 1.312-313, no. 299, 111 or 110 B.C.) reads, not Q(uaestores) Ur(bani), but Q. Ur(binius), and considers him a IIIvir monetalis along with Ap. Cl. and T. Mal. or Manl. See below, on C. Urbinus (2), RE 9A.995.
Pr. 104. Monetalis. In MRR 2.443, and Index, 581, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.306-307, no. 292, 113 or 112 B.C. Note Crawford's opposing discussion of L. R. Taylor, RVA 39, on the arrangement and meaning of the voting scenes.
Senator? 44-43. The Octavius Balbus who was proscribed and put to death in 43 (Val. Max. 5.7.3** App. BC 4.21) probably was the C. Octavius who joined the tyrannicides on the Capitol (Plul. Caes. 67.2). See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 124.
Senator. One of the proscribed, restored by M. Antonius. Before the Actium campaign he was the only senator to vote against declaring him a public enemy (App. BC 4.45), or stripping him of his powers (Dio 50.4.3, and 6.1). (RS, MS-RP 1.288** TJC)
Cos. 202 (MRR 1.315), or (250), Pr. 181 (1.384) or (251), Pr. 178 (1.395). Leg., Amb. a, b, 172 (MRR 1.412, and see 415, notes 4-6). On these embassies, see Walbank, Comm. on Polyb. 3.294-295. In embassy b, correct T. to Ti.[55]
Aed. desig. 42? He was killed by the soldiers who had killed his father (see below, no. 7), perhaps while only aedile designate since there appears to have been little time for entrance upon office (App. BC 4.18** see MRR 2.359). (TJC) **
Senator and praetorius of the period of the Social War (Plin. NH 33.21), therefore not no. 97. Being mentioned by his gentilicium, he was probably not one of the more distinguished Calpurnii, such as the Pisones. (RS, MS-RP 1.277-278).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.444, and Index, 585-586, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.318, no. 309, 118-117 B.C. Crawford (loc. Sit.) suggests that he may be the Leg., lieut. of 107-105 (RE no. 12** MRR 1.552, 555, 557).
Senator in 44. A brother of Bucilianus (1), who was present with him in the Senate at the murder of Caesar (App. BC 2.117), and was one of the conspirators (ibid. 213). He may possibly be identified with Caecilius (1). Quaestor 59.
Prefect? 62. An officer under the governor Valerius Flaccus in Asia at Apamea in 62, who took possession of the Jewish contributions for the Temple in Jerusalem (Cic. Flacc. 65** see A. J. Marshall, Phoenix 29, 1975, 139-154, esp. 148).
Pr. 59. See MRR 2.188. Presided over the trial of C. Antonius  (Cic. Vat. 27), apparently in the quaestio de repetundis (Schol. Bob. 94St), not de maiestate (see Gruen, Latomus 32, 1973, 301-310** cf. LGRR 288).
A knight resident in Syracuse, perhaps an officer under C. Sempronius Asellio (Diod. 37.8.1) but perhaps only an associate and advisor. See below, on C. (Sempronius) Longus (64). Cf. Schleussner, Legaten 251, no. 120, and p. 154.
Pr. 82. As the term praetor in Orosius (5.21.10) for his command in 82 may stand also for propraetor (Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 267), this Marian commander may have been a praetor in 83 (Plut. Pomp. 7.1, one of three #), or even in 84.
He was not, as I suggested in MRR 2.489, and Index, 544, a Cornelius Lentulus, since the names Caudina, Caudenius, and Caudinus are attested (Wiseman, NM 223, no. 111** Gruen, LGRR 202, note 155** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 25).
Legatus under Verres in Sicily, probably in 72, since he is mentioned in connection with T. Vettius and the trial of the nauarchi (Cic. Verr. 2.5.114). See now N. Marinone, AAT 100, 1965-66, 219252** and above, on Q. Caecilius Niger (101).
Procos. Illyria, ca. 61-60 (Cic. Fam. 13.42** see MRR 2.183, 191). On his province and date, see now Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.353** and CLA 3.263 on Att. 6.3.6 for the suggestion that his nomen may have been Cornelius (cf. Cic. Div. 1.4).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.454, and Index, 628, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.483-485, no. 474, 45 B.C. He is probably the Valerius Acisculus (93), a tr. pl. of this period who is named by Porphyry in his comment on Hor. Sat. 1.2.94.
Tr. pl. 44. His action when, as prefect or legate, he was in command of several cohorts in the battle of Alexandria on March 27 (January 14), 47, was decisive (Bell. Alex. 31..1-3)Add notices in MRR 2.292, 47 B.C., and Index, 542.
Tr. Mil., XXVIvir, q. pro pr. in the early Augustan period (CIL 6.1317-ILS 909). Possibly a son of the praetor of 62 (35** MRR 2.173) and a senator by 31. (TJC) See Suolahti, Junior Officers 316, 406** De Laet, no. 277.
J. Suolahti suggests that his rank in the concilium of L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus, Cos. 49, in Asia that year as listed in Josephus (AJ 14.229, 238) was either quaestor or military tribune (Arctos 2, 1958, 152-163).
Tr. pl. 470. See MRR 1.31. Note that J.-C. Richard, Origines de la plebe romaine 529, prefers Sicinius, the reading of Diodorus and the properly plebeian name** cf. Ogilvie, Comm. Liv. 382. See T. Sicinius (13). Cos. 487.
Tr. pl. 58. He vetoed, not a tribunicial proposal by his colleague Ninnius for recall of Cicero from exile (see MRR 2.195), but a decree of the Senate proposed by Ninnius on June 1, 57 (Cic. Sest. 68). See also Dom. 49** Har. Resp. 5.
Pr. 46, Cos. 43. In MRR 2.295, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.478, no. 466, 46 B.C. Cos. 43. In MRR 2.336, on his public burial, refer also to AEpig. 1941, no. 102-ILLRP 419, and note also CIL 1_.2.2524-ILLRP 420 (a brother?).
He served in Pompeian forces in Spain, Greece, and Africa in 49-46, and was an officer when he was released after capture in Spain in 49 upon promise not to serve against Caesar again (Bell. Afr. 64). His title is not attested. (TJC)
Monetalis. In MRR 2.455, and Index, 633, delete the word B(arrus), and refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.266-267, no. 234, 137 B.C. Perhaps a son of T. Veturius Gracchi f. Sempronianus, augur from 174 (Badian, Arethusa 1, 1968, 31-36).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.439, and Index, 560, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.286, no. 261, 128 B.C. Crawford suggests that he was either a Domitius Calvinus or one of a collateral line of the Ahenobarbi.
Pr. and procos., Transalpine Gaul and Spain. His defeat should be dated between that of Domitius and Thorius Balbus in 79 (MRR 2.84) and the arrival of Pompey in 77 or 76. See MRR 2.83, 87, and Badian, Mel. Piganiol 910.
Pr. urb. 28. He is named in a list of praetors of 28 (CIL 11.7412), and as curule aedile in CIL 6.31759-ILS 5921, cf. 7856, and in an inscription quoted by Pliny (NH 34.93). He should be listed as at least a senator by 31.
Termed homo quaestorius in the passage of Cic. Tog. Cand. quoted by Ascon. 93C. See MRR 2.122, 71 B.C.** below, on L. Turius (2)** and Shackleton Bailey, CLA 1.291-292** further discussion in B. A. Marshall, A C 47, 1978, 207-209.
Legates, envoys. Two brothers, probably officers, who were sent by Crassus at Carrhae in 53 to negotiate with the Parthian commander (Plut. Crass. 21.2)Add this notice in MRR 2.231. See J. Suolahti, Junior Officers 248, 284, 293, 385.
Tr. Pl. ? 49? See MRR 2.259** Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 129** NM 256-257, no. 363. Wiseman suggests that since other known Rubrii were enemies of Caesar, the author of the Lex Rubria should be identified with L. Rubrius (12) of Casinum.
Leg., lieut. 43-42. In MRR 2.366, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.516-517, no. 505, 43-42 B.C. He served under C. Cassius Imp. (59) and Q. Caepio Brutus Imp. (53). See Syme, Hermes 92, 1964, 410** and Sherk, RDGE no. 27, pp. 158-162.
Cos. suff. 23. Pro quaestore in Spain, under Pompey, 49. In MRR 2.261, and Index, 542, add a reference to Crawford, RRC 1.463, no. 446, 49 B.C. In MRR 2.261 the cross-reference is to 2.100, note 7 (75 B.C.).[47]
Senator in 44? A young follower of Cato (Plut. Cat. Min. 65.4, #) whom Brutus considered for a part in the conspiracy against Caesar, but decided against it (Plut. Brut. 12.3** cf. Cat. Min. 73.4). (TJC) See Wiseman, NM 263, no. 402.
His place in the list in the SC de agro Pergameno suggests that he was then of praetorian rank (129 B.C.)** see Wiseman, NM 210, no. 15** Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73. On the date, see below on M'. Aquillius (10).
See MRR, Index, 2.570. Cos. desig. for 29, but since another had occupied his place he was adlected by Augustus among the consulares in that year (Dio 42.4** cf. 54.4.5, governor in Spain). See PIR_ F 590** Wiseman, NM 233, no. 188.
See MRR 2.92, 132. Shackleton Bailey (Studies 5051) doubts if two such different personalities as those of the IIIvir Cap. Ca. 77(Cic. Cluent. 77), and of the Tr. Pl. desig. For 69 ( Verr. 1.30), could **exist in the same person.
Quaestor under Verres in eastern Sicily in 73, and mentioned in connection with the case of Heraclius in that year (Cic. Verr. 2.2.44). He probably did not continue (Verr. 2.2.49). See N. Marinone, AAT 100, 1965-1966, 219-252.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.434, and Index, 541, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.278, no. 247, 133 B.C. See Syme, RP 1.278** perhaps a Calpurnius Lanarius, since the Pisones did not use the praenomen P.** Wiseman, NM 280, no. 528.[45]
Tr. pl. 100 or 99? In MRR 2.2, note for name and possible background, P. Fourios, dictator tertium at Lanuvium (ILLRP 129a). On the date of his tribunate, see above, on L. Appuleius Saturninus (29). See Wiseman, NM 233, no. 189.
A senator who was proscribed in 43,(App. BC 4.27, #). Probably not identifiable with L. Flaminius (7), but might be a Vettius, an Annius, a Toranius, or a Magius, or, if the cognomen was really Gillo, a Fulvius (RS, MS 55-60-RP 1.270).
Senator. Asconius' remark that Q. Cornificius (7), consular candidate for 63, was tantum non primus in his family to win a magistracy, suggests that there was a previous senator of the name (Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 123).
Tr. pl. 126. His aedileship, which is placed conjecturally in 123 in MRR 1.513, three years after his tribunate, is dated more in accord with the order in Cic. Brut. 109 by Sumner in 119 or 118 (Orators 67).
Listed in RE under Q. Varus (5). The praefectus equitum under Fabius in Gaul in 51, Q. Atius (not Attius) Varus (MRR 2.246) may also be the praefectus under Domitius Calvinus in 48 (Caes. BC 3.37.5** MRR 2.283).
Named on a milestone near Gabii with Caecilius Q. f. (CIL 1_.2.833). The letters CVR appear on the stone, which may be dated to the third or early second century. A curule aedile or curator of uncertain date. (RS, CP)
Cos. 281. P. Leveque (Pyrrhus 281, note 5) credits the consuls of 281 with the stratagem described in Frontin. Str. 1.4.1 (cf. 4.4.2), which is attributed to Aemilius Papus (112). Cos. 278, in MRR 1.194.
Cos. 130. Pr. 137? in Sicily. On the praetors of Sicily during the First Slave War, see below, on L. Plautius Hypsaeus (20). For his filiation, see Sumner, Orators 143, with stemma.[65]
Cos. 121. Monetalis. In MRR 2.447, and Index, 596, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.281, no. 253, 131 B.C. In MRR 1.520, refer also to Cic. Ad Quir. 11** Sest. 140** Pis. 95** Planc. 69-70** Mil. 8, 83 (Shackleton Bailey, Onom.).
Pr. 82. See MRR 2.67. Appian's phrase, # (BC 1.88), as T. J. Luce has[112x] shown, does not mean pr. urbanus, but only praetor in or of the city (CPh 56, 1961, 21-28, esp. 22-23). Delete the word urbanus.
Cos. 189. Procos. Asia 188-187 (MRR 2.366-369). Envoys were sent from Apollonia Salbace to Apameia to him as proconsul and to the ten legates (J. and L. Robert, La Carie 2.303- 312-Aepig. 1955, no. 280).
Tr. Mil. c. p. 426, Tr. mil. 437. In MRR 1.59, 437 B.C., and note 2, add references to R. M. Ogilvie, Comm. Liv. 563-567, on 4.20.5-11** T. J. Luce, TAPhA 96, 1965, 209-240, esp. 209-218, 238-240.
As Crawford has pointed out, the quadrantes of C. Cur(iatius) f. Trige(minus) (11) (see MRR 2.438) were misread and gave rise to this name (RRC 1.547, Appendix I). Delete this entry in MRR 2.434, and Index, 542.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.438, and Index, 558, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.260, no. 223, 142 B.C., who suggests that the older Curiatius, rather than the younger (11), was the tr. pl. of 138 (see MRR 2.438).
One of the proscribed in 43 (App. BC 4.29). Brother (see PIR_ H 24, at end** RE 7.2513) or, more probably, father (so Syme RP 1.271) of Q. Haterius the orator, Cos. Buff. In 5, whose family was senatorial (Tae. Ann. 4.61).
Senator in 43? He was Suetonius' authority for a dispute in the Senate between Octavian and Lepidus about the proscriptions (Suet. Aug. 27.2). Mènzer (RE) considers him a senator. See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 124.
Cos. 128, Or[150] Cn. Octavius Cn. f. Cn. n. (20). Cos. 87. Badian (Studies 104, note 168) notes that the inscription of Delos (I. De Delos 1782** see MRR 2.26) may well refer to the future consul of 128.
Leg., lieut. 75, 74 (MRR 2.100). Refer also to SIG? 1125, dated by Cichorius (RS 187) to the early first century, a dedication by him and his brothers A. Pompeius (4) and Sex. Pompeius (16) at Eleusis.
Tr. Mil.? 211. His name is given in Liv. 25.37.3 as L. Marcius Septimi filius, but in 28.28.13 and 32.2.5 as L. Marcius Septimus. His title remains uncertain. See MRR 1.275, 277, note 8** Suolahti, Junior Officers 372.
He issued coins in 49 in Spain inscribed Varro Proq. Magn. Procos. See MRR 2.100, note 7, and now Crawford, RRC 1.463, no. 447. To be distinguished from M. Terentius Varro, whose title was Legatus pro praetore.
Tr. pl. 103. See MRR 1.563. Recorded in Auct. Vir. Ill. 73.1, as a Tr. pl., colleague of Saturninus, who attempted to veto his African land bill. See RE no. 17, and in MRR 2.537 read Tr. pl. (not mil.).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.434, and Index, 542, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.442-443, no. 418, 61 B.C. The moneyer was M. Pupius Piso, Pr. 44, son of the consul of 61. See below, on Pupius (12).
Rex sacrorum 208-180. Monetalis. In MRR 2.437, add this name with a note on the canting type of the dolabella. There and in the Index, 552, refer to Crawford, RRC 1.175, no. 81, 211-209 B.C.[64]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.437, and Index, 557, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.298-299, no. 282, 118 B.C. Crawford associates him and the other curatores denariorum flandorum with the founders of the colony of Narbo.
A man of praetorian stock (stirpe praetoria) who fought as a gladiator in Caesar's games in 46 (Suet. Iul. 39.1). No certainly a senator then or earlier. See above, on Fulvius Sepinus (108) (RS, MS-RP 1.281-282)
Senator. A calamitosus whom Mark Antony restored in 49, so probably a senator (Cic. Phil. 2.56, with the reading Denticula in some mss** Dio 45.47.1 #). (TJC) See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 47.
Pr. Africa 105. In MRR 1.556, delete the gentilicium Annius. Bellienus is well attested as such (Cic. Fam. 16.22.2** 8.15.2** Phil. 2.91** see Shackleton Bailey, CLF 1.489** Wiseman, NM 217, no. 66).
IIIvir monetalis. In MRR 2.436, Index, 550, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.473- 475, no. 463, 46 B.C. Pr. procos. In MRR 2.463, refer also to Degrassi, ILLRP 414, who considers this to be a single office.
Tr. mil. 72. He may have been a quaestor under Pompey when he died at Aenus in 67 (Plut. Cat. Min. 11** Badian, Studies 42), to the great sorrow of his half-brother Cato. See MRR 2.119, 121, note 3. ,
Cos. 174. Tr. Mil. 171. In MRR 1.417, refer also to Liv. 42.49.9. On Mucius and P. Cornelius Lentulus (202), see Schleussner, Legaten 104, note 17. On Lentulus as a legate, see also Livy 42.56.4.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.433, and Index, 537, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.209f., no. 133, 194-190 B.C. Perhaps C. Baebius Tamphilus (42), pr. 168, or, more probably, M. Baebius Tamphilus (44). Cos. 181.
Son of the consul of 94. A praetor of uncertain date, probably also a promagistrate, since he is termed IMP on the coins of his nephew (RE no. 14). See Gruen, LGRR 164, note 2. See MRR 2.485, and Index, 549.
Tr. pl. ca. 153? In MRR 1.452-453, refer also to Cic. Verr. 2.1.109, where, it appears, the reading Fufias leges should replace Fusias leges. See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 39-40. See above on Aelius (1) and Fufius (1).
Legatus of Q. Metellus in Crete, 67. See MRR 2.147. Syme suggests that # in Dio 36.19 may be a mistake for # (RP 2.610). For the name see Cic. Att. 12.5.2** cf. Fam. 7.20.3. See also Wiseman, NM 280, no. 526.
A senator who died in 75 (Cic. Verr. 2.1.104, with praenomen C., 107 and 113** 2.2.21, senatorius). Note the quaestor in Sicily, P. Ann. or P. Ani., MRR 2.478. (RS, MS-RP 1.274).
In RE s.v. Fabius, no. 17, the praetor of 58 and proconsul in Asia in 57 is identified with Caesar's leg., lieut. of 54-49. Caesar's legate was more probably the tribune of the plebs of 55 (MRR 2.217).
Tribunus plebis of uncertain date, but if the Acilius, Censor, who gave him a nota (Fronto ad Caes. 5.26 [41]** 5.27 [42)) was M'. Acilius Glabrio (38). Cos. 67, and probably Censor 64, the date was ca. 64.[128x]
In MRR 2.27, and Index, 583, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.315, no. 305, 109 or 108 B.C. The whole entry should be transferred to MRR 1.549, and Lutatius listed as quaestor in 109 or 108 B.C.
Quaestor ca. 74-66, termed a senator in 66 (Cic. Cluent. 165). See MRR 2.103. His coinage is dated to 74 by Crawford, RRC 1.408, no. 396. For a stemma, see Wiseman, NM 251, nos. 318 and 320.
Cos. 354, 351. Dictator 361. In MRR 1.119, refer also to Eutrop. 2.5** App. Celt. 11. Note. The spelling of the cognomen Poenus should be changed to Pennus in MRR.
In MRR 1.489, refer also to J. Heurgon (REL 27, 1949, 106-108), who would identify this curule aedile with the future consul of 131, and finds a plebeian colleague, Minucius, no barrier.
Tr. pl. desig. for 42. In MRR 2.359, reverse the order of the words in the name. See CIL 9.5560, the name L. Hostilius Tullus. (TJC) See Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 117-RP 2.595** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 45.
Cos. 65? Proq(uaestor). In MRR 2.61, 64, 70, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.386-387, no. 367, with the date 82 for this gold and silver coinage under Sulla. Very probably the future consul of 65.
Cos. 113? In MRR 2.448, change (39) to (37), and both there and in the Index, 598, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.296, no. 279, 121 B.C. Crawford identifies this Carbo with the consul of 113.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.454, and Index, 630, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.457, no. 435, 53 B.C. He was perhaps the cos. suff: of 32 (no. 255), or a son of the cos. of 53 (268).
Sent as legatus to Hannibal in 219 and to Carthage in 218** see MRR 1.237 and 239. The spelling Tampilus in Cic. Phil. 5.27, as late as 43 B.C., may be a deliberate archaism (Shackleton Bailey, Onom.)
Degrassi (ILLRP 340-ILS 5742) suggests that he made his announcement of the aqueduct at Caiatia to the pr. urbanus as Praefectus Capuam Cumas. Perhaps a son of Q. Fulvius Nobilior (95). Cos. 153.
Cos. Suff. 32. If he was a son of the consul of 53 (no. 268), as Syme suggests (JRS 45, 1955, 157?RP 1.264), he may be identified with Messal. f., monetalis in 53 (see above, no. 254).
On the cognomen, see Cic. Phil. 5.5 and 7, Cotylo, but in Phil. 8.24 and 28, and 13.26, Cotyla. In Plut. Ant. 18.8, it is #** cf. Cotulo in CIL 1_.5686. On the praenomen, see Cic. Phil. 8.33. See MRR 2.323.
Tr. pl. 90. See MRR 2.26-27. For discussion of his law, its context, and its effects, see Gruen, JRS 55, 1965, 59-73** and RPCC 216-220** E. Badian, Quaestiones Variae, Historia 18, 1969, 447-491.
Tr. pl. 51. Shackleton Bailey (CLF 1.404) reads the name as C. Coelius, not Caelius, in Fam. 8.8.7-8, and distinguishes him from C. Caelius Rufus, leg. pro pr. in Achaea, and tr. pl. desig. (on him, see above).
Lupercus. A freedman, termed mag. Luperc. in CIL 1_.2.1004-ILS 1924-ILLRP 696** cf. Plin. NH 34.11. The spelling Clesipus and the lettering favor a date in the late Republic (Mènzer, RE no. 3) (RS, CP)
Praetor. See MRR 2.9, and 10, note 3. His governorship in Sicily is subsequent to that of Mucius Scaevola in Asia (Diod. 37.8.1-4** Badian, PACA 11, 1968, 2-3** and cf. above, on Mucius, RE no. 22).
Cos. 206. Probably a legate under the consul Ap. Claudius Pulcher (293) at Capua in 212 (Liv. 26.33.5-7). His curule aedileship in 210 should be queried (see MRR 1.279, 284, note 2).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.438, and Index, 558, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.300-301, no. 285, 116 or 115 B.C., and his note on the difficulty of identifying the members of the triumvirate which included Curtius.
Quaestor pro pr. Named in an inscription of Tibur, probably early Augustan: Pacceio L. f. I q. pro pr. | Ostienses | navicularei (CIL 14.3603-ILS 6171** Aepig. 1955, no. 178). See Wiseman, NM 248, no. 299.
Named in a decree of Pergamum about 132, reported by Josephus (AJ 14.251). Syme, against Mènzer (RE) and Marcus (in LCL), considers him a Roman senator (RS, MS-RP 1.285-286** see now Wiseman, NM 251, no. 317).
Senator in 63** see MRR 2.491. He is perhaps to be identified with A. Fulvius A. f. Tro. in Pompeius Strabo's consilium in 89 (Cichorius, RS 175** see now Criniti, L'Epigrafe di Asculum 21, 165-166). (LRT)
Cos. 116. Monetalis. In MRR 2.439, and Index, 563, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.288-289, no. 265, 127 B.C. Most probably the consul of 116, Fabius Maximus Eburnus (111). See below.
Quaestor in Africa in the late Republic or the early Augustan period. He was honored by the mancup(es) stipend(forum) ex Africa (CIL 6.31713-ILS 901). See PIR_ 3.196, no. 462. (RS, MSRP 1.281** TJC)[92x]
Senator in 70. See MRR 2.492. Wiseman suggests that he was a brother of the L. Iunius Q. f. Lem. in the consilium of Pompeius Strabo in 89 (NM 236, no. 217** see Criniti, L?Epigrafe di Asculum 20, 141- 142).
See MRR 2.465. See Cicero (Fam. 8.8.1) on his conviction for calumnia in a case against M. Tuccius. See also Shackleton Bailey CLF 1.397-398, and CLA 3.192** Weinrib, Phoenix 25, 1971, 149, note 6.
Perhaps praetor in 83 or 82, he was proconsul in one, or probably both, Spanish provinces (two quaestors) in 82-81 (MRR 2.77). On his coinage there, see Crawford, RRC 1.381386, no. 366.
Pr. 58. Perhaps the Flavius who Atticus heard had been given command of a legion and of Sicily by Caesar in April 49 (Cic. Att. 10.1.2), the command that was given to Curio. See Syme, RR 66, note 1. (TJC)
Monetalis. 3n MRR 2.431, and Index, 530, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.257, no. 219, 146 B.C. Against Babelon, Crawford finds no evidence for an Antestius Labeo in the second century B.C.
Legatus pro quaestore of C. Sentius in Macedonia, 93-86. In MRR 2.15, 17, note 7, and elsewhere, for Bruttius, use the spelling Braitius, as in IG 9.2.613. See Wiseman, NM 217, no. 70.
Senator? A partisan of M. Antonius in 43 whom Cicero names in a list of senators, although he is not specifically termed one (Cic. Phil. 11.13** cf. 13.26-28, a list which does not include him).[83]
Primus. Legatus pro praetore of the proconsul of Achaea, named in an inscription of Olympia (L Olymp. 235), late republican or early Augustan in date (De Laet, no. 439 bis** PIR_ A 515). (TJC)
The Reginus to whom Cicero refers in May 49 (Att. 10.21.1), perhaps as a naval commander, may be identified with Caesar's legatus in Gaul, 53-50 (TJC** RS, CP** Shackleton Bailey, CLA 4.203).
See MRR 2.325, 344, 364. On his coinage when serving under Brutus and Cassius in 43-42, see now Crawford, RRC 1.514-515, no. 500. See Shackleton Bailey, Studies 113- 114.
If Veiento was also the cognomen of M. Perperna (5), Fabricius becomes merely one of the possible gentilicia of the legatus whom Bibulus left in command in Syria in 50 (MRR 2.253).[88]
Monetalis. In MRR 2.454, and Index, 626, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.344, no. 341, 90 B.C. See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 131** NM 266, no. 437. Cf. also Cichorius, Untersuch. Zu Lucilius 206- 208.
Safra. Crawford notes that since there is never a point between S and AFRA on these coins, the legend should be regarded as a cognomen, not a nomen such as the S. Afra(nius) in MRR 2.431 (RRC 1.251, no. 206, 150 B.C.).
Perhaps identifiable with the CAP who issued coins as an officer of the triumviri at Lipara in 37-36 (MRR 2.405-406** Grant, FITA 52-54). (TJC) See MRR 2.462** Wiseman NM 215-216, no. 53.
Cos. 458. See MRR 1.39. J. Suolahti suggests Fabius, Furius, Iulius, and Manlius as shorter nomina possible with this cognomen but considers Furius the most probable (Arctos 3, 1962, 215-228).
Tr. pl. or pr. before 175. Cato the Elder urged the passage of a Lex Maevia, mentioning a rex Seleucus, who died in 176 or 175 (Priscian 12.17, Malcovati, ORF_ 92, no. 228). See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 124.
An aged senator in 76 (MRR 2.493). Sumner points out that in Cic. Ross. Com. 43-49, the mss readings vary between Manlius and Manilius and may refer to an elder T. Manlius Torquatus (Orators 130-131).
officer under Sextus Pompey. On the issue of coins, refer to Crawford, RRC 1.494-496, no. 483, 44-43 B.C. On his service with Sex. Pompey, see MRR 2.394. See J. Suolahti, Junior Officers 267, 328, 345.
Senator? The Publilius whose allowance to his son, along with that of the flamen Lentulus to his, was a subject of discussion between Cicero and his son was perhaps another senator (Cic. Att. 12.7.1). (TJC)
Pr. 77, Procos. Asia? 76. An inscription of Priene (I. Priene 121) names several # sent to Asia by the Romans (a formula regular for governors, Sumner GRBS 19, 1978, 151, note 16),
Tr. Pl. 54. Monetalis. In MRR 2.446, and Index, 590, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.451- 452, no. 427, 56 B.C. Tr. Pl. 54. See Crawford, loc. Cit.** Wiseman, NC 1964, 157** CR 17, 1967, 167, note,2.
Senator before 35. Named as a candidate for an office in Hor. Sat. 1.6.12-20 (written before 35). Porphyrio (ad loc.) states that he could not go beyond the quaestorship. (TJC)[212x]
Quaestor 43. Although he is termed quaestor in 43 he was present in the Senate among Caesar's murderers (Veil. 2.89.3). Had Caesar adlected him? Or was he already a proquaestor in 43? (TJC)
Praetor 85 or 84. In MRR 2.60, refer also to CIL 1_.2.718-ILLRP 363.  Propraetor in Africa, until 82 (MRR 2.64, 69), but his death is dated probably late in 83 by Badian, Studies 72.
Pr. 63. Combine the entries under these two names (see MRR 2.125, 167, and Index, 605) as C. Pomptinus, since the text of Frontin. Str. 2.4.7 on the legate of 71 should be emended to Pomptinus.[167]
Quaestor in Spain, late Republic. Correct the praenomen to L. both in MRR 2.476, and the Index, 582. He should not be identified with the monetalis of Vesci, whose praenomen was C. (TJC)
See MRR 2.474. Better to list him as a senator before 77. See Wiseman, NM 271, no. 471. (Velleius) Capito (4), Senator in 43. See MRR 2.497. For a stemma of the family, see Wiseman, NM 271, no. 472.
Pr(ocos.?) Syria 32-31. In MRR 2.419, refer also to Sydenham, CRR lxix, 200** Crawford, RRC 1.545, no. 550, who rejects this attribution and this date, and tentatively suggests Q. Oppius (20), above.
Praetor 90. See MRR 2.26. Mènzer (RE no. 13) favors 91 as the date of his praetorship, and Albinus as his cognomen. If so, he would be a promagistrate or a legate when killed at Nola early in 90.
Senator in 44. As one of the conspirators against Caesar (App. BC 2.113), he was probably a senator in 44. On the name, see ILS 5578-ILLRP 609. See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 131** NM 262, no. 409. (TJC)
Leg., lieut. of L. Antonius, 41, of Sex. Pompey, 40-36 (see MRR 2.376, 405). Wiseman (CR 15, 1965, 19-20, and NM 266, no. 434) suggests that his name should be read as [Ti]tisienus Gallus.[205]
A member of the staff of the praetor L. Plaetorius (16) when he was made a proxenos at Delphi (SEG 1.165, without title), perhaps an officer. See Wiseman, NM 270, no. 464.
Senator in 44. The correct reading in Joseph. AJ 14.220 is in favor of the name given above instead of the emendation Gellius (#** AM #). See below on M. Gellius (7). (TJC, LRT)
When he was expelled from the Senate in 18 (Dio 54.14.3) he was old enough to have a son a senator at that time. So he was probably a senator by 31. (TJC) See Wiseman, NM 214, no. 43.
IIIIvir A. P. F. In MRR 2.447, Index, 594, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.502- 511, no. 494, 42 B.C. With L. Livineius, P. Clodius, and C. Vibius Varus. See Wiseman, NM 243, no. 268.
Quaestor pro praetore of uncertain date. Named in a pavement inscription found at Hippo Regius (AEpig. 1955, no. 148). See Syme, Historia 5, 1956, 209-RP 1.320** Wiseman, NM 270, no. 468.
Cos. 74. Named, almost certainly with Lucullus, in an inscription which dates the restoration of the pavement of the temple of Diana Tifatina (A. Ferrua, AEpig. 1956, no. 37).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.439, and Index, 561, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.326-327, no. 322, 102 B.C. Probably C. Fabius C. f Hadrianus (cf. ILLRP 363). In MRR 2.561, delete Buteo.[85]
Senator 161. See MRR 2.493. Read T. Manlius Fab. or Fal. The name as written on the stone (SIG? 679, II) is # :.., perhaps the same as the # of II Maccab. 11.34. Probably patrician. (LRT)
Monetalis. In MRR 2.445, and Index, 588, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.307- 308, no. 293, 113 or 112 B.C. He may be identified with the consul of 91 and censor of 86 (RE no. 75).
Monetalis and Quaestor designatus. In MRR 2.455, 477, and Index, 635, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.530-531, no. 526, 40 B.C. or later. He issued coins with Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (56).
Described as legatus propraetore in an inscription of Tibur of late republican or early Augustan date (CIL 14.3546-ILS 3414). (RS, MS-RP 1.285) See Wiseman, NM 246, 286.
Pr. procos., Hisp. Ult. 180-178. Castra Postumiana may be his foundation. See now R. C. Knapp, Aspects 29, 194. Cos. 173. In MRR 1.407-408, refer also to Liv. 43.2.9.
Promag. Sicily 44-42. Sumner (Phoenix 25, 1971, 360) has shown that his praetorship (see MRR 2.307), though possible, is not proved by his command in Sicily in 44-42 (MRR 2.329, 348).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.450, and Index, 610, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.311-312, no. 294, 112 or 111 B.C. He may be a Quinctilius and is unlikely to be a Flamininus (Crawford, loc. cit.).
the author of the De Architectura. On his status, an architect, and on the question whether he may be identified with Caesar?s Praefectus fabrum, Mamurra, see above, on Mamurra.[222]
Aedile? by 39. See MRR 2.466, 488. The tribe is attested as # in the SC de Panamareis. See Sherk, RDGE no. 27, 158-162** Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 113** Wiseman, NM 216, no. 87.
A Sullan victim, adlected into the senate by Caesar (Cic. Fam. 13.5.2). Cicero tried to save his estate at Volaterrae, on which his rank depended, from being distributed to veterans (RS, CP).
Monetalis, probably IIIIvir. See MRR 2.198, 446. Dated to 44 also by Crawford (RRC 1.487-495, no. 480). Perhaps the M. Metius (Maecius?) sent by Caesar to parley with Ariovistus (BG 1.47 and 53).
Quaestor urbanus 49. See MRR 2.259. The praenomen comes from identification by Mènzer with Cn. Nerius Pup. In Cic. QF 2.3.5. On his coinage, see now Crawford, RRC 1.460-461, no. 441, 49 B.C.
Probably praetor in Rome by or before 83** his coinage in Rome is dated to 83 by Crawford (RRC 1:379, no. 364). Propraetor in Sardinia in 82 (MRR 2.57** Badian, Studies 100, note 79).
Pr. 188 or 185. In MRR 1.372 and elsewhere, read 223 or 224. In the text of Liv. 39.23.2, Sage (LCL) and Weissenborn read Marcellinus, the MS reading (JRS 51, 1961, 240).
Leg. f. c. in Africa, 46. In MRR 2.301 (cf. 490), refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.471, no. 461, 47-46 B.C., who suggests that his title was Legatus fisci castrensis (cf. ILS 1570).
Probably a legatus with M. Domitius Calvinus in Hisp. Cit. in 80-79 (MRR 2.84), who was greatly disturbed at his death (Sall. Hist. 1.136M** Bischoff-Bloch, WS n.s. 13, 1979, 116-129).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.453, and Index, 622, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.459-460, no. 438, 51 B.C. Probably son of the consul of 51, and a senator in 49 (MRR 2.497).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.455, and Index, 634, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.502-511, no. 494, 42 B.C. With L. Livineius Regulus, P. Clodius M. f., and L. Mussidius T. f. Longus as IIIIviri.
He was expelled from the Senate by the censors of 115 on suspicion of assisting the candidacy of his friend Marius for the praetorship by bribery (Plut. Mar. 5.3-4). (RS, MS-RP 1.278-279).
Monetalis. See MRR 2.452. Crawford, RRC 1.228, no. 169, dates the coins Of GR to 199170, and, rightly, sees no reason to identify him with a Sempronius Gracchus.
Quaestor 143. See MRR 1.472. Refer also to Macrob. Sat. 1.6.30. In 1.487, with SIG? 688, refer also to Sherk, RDGE no. 10, 135 B.C. See above, on Tremellius (5).[207x]
The runaway slave who attained the praetorship (Ulpian, Dig. 1.14.3** .Suda, #). See below, on M. Barbatius Pollio. (RS, MS-RP 1.276-277** TJC) See Wiseman, NM 217, no. 63.
Aed. cur. 58. In MRR 2.195, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.446, no. 422. Praetor by 55? In MRR 2.216, refer also to CIL 1_.2.1359-ILLRP 386: [P.?] Plauti Hypsaei | [praet]or(is).
Pr. 66. The senator C. Gallus mentioned in Cic. Verr. 2.3.152 may probably be identified with the praetor of 66 (Badian, Gnomon 33, 1961, 396** Shackleton Bailey, Studies 40-41).
Cos. 98, or Q. (Caecilius) Mete(llus) (Numidicus) (97). Cos. 109. In MRR 2.433-434, and Index, 539, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.300, no. 284, 117 or 116 B.C.[39]
Legatus in Asia, early first century, but the date is uncertain** known from an inscription in honor of his daughter, Coelia Polla (L Magn. 148). See Syme, JRS 53, 1963, 55, note 4-RP 2.554-558.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.442, and Index, 576, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.259, no. 220, 145 B.C. Crawford would identify him with the tr. pl. before 123 (RE no. 169** MRR 1.513).
As his son was a senator and remained in the Senate after he was removed in 18, it is probable that he entered the Senate before 31 (Dio 54.14.2). See De Laet, 59, no. 218. (TJC)
Tr. pl. 103. See MRR 1.563, 564. The nomen Antistius is supported by the nomen and cognomen of Caesar's legatus in 53-52 (C. Antistius Reginus (39]** MRR 2.231, 238).
Senator in 44. One of Caesar's murderers (App. BC 2.113, 117** cf. Cic. Att. 15.17.2** 16.4.4). His brother was named Caecilius, a name which should be deleted from the entry in MRR 2.488.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.439, and Index, 558, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.410- 411, no. 399, 72 B.C. See also B. Levick and S. Jameson, JRS 54, 1964, 98-106, esp. 100.[77]
Praetor? in 54. See MRR 2.221, 227, note 1. Gruen (LGRR 166, note 8) identifies him with Cn. Domitius Calvinus (43), Pr. 56, and probably quaesitor in 54** cf. Shackleton Bailey, CQF 195.
Cos. 47. Monetalis. In MRR 2.440, and Index, 567, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.413, no. 403, 70 B.C. Praetor 59. In MRR 2.188-189, refer also to Cic. Att. 2.18.1.
In MRR 2.264, 49 B.C., refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.463, no. 447, 49 B.C. On Varro as proq. under Cn. Pompeius Magnus, procos. in Spain, see MRR 2.100, note 7.

Quaestor Syria 50 (MR 2.250). Read (L.) Marius. The praenomen depends on identification with RE no. 20. See Ascon. 19C, where an accuser of Scaurus in 54 is named L. Marius L. f. (TJC)
Procos. Sicily, 27-23, and therefore probably a senator by 31 (BMC Cat., Sicilia 128, no. 13). Perhaps L. Seius L. f. Aem. Firm... , CIL 10.4259 at Eryx. See Wiseman, CQ 14, 1964, 130.
Probably a senator by 31. He appears in a praetorian position near the beginning of the list of witnesses in the SC de Mitylenaeis (IGRP 4.33) of 25. (TJC** LRT)
Aed. before 73. Correct the entry Ani. in the Index, MRR 2.636, to Arn., the tribe indicated by the reading # in SIG? 747** see MRR 2.115** Sherk, RDGE no. 23, pp. 133-138.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.433, and Index 538, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.333- 336, no. 335, 96 B.C.? With C. Mall. and A. Alb. Too early a date for the consul of 68 B.C.
Quaestor 76. See MRR 2.93. Sent by Sertorius ca. 75 as envoy to Mithridates, who gave him a command in the Third Mithridatic War (Plut. Sert. 24.2** Luc. 8.5** called # in App. Mith. 77).
Monetalis with his brother C. Memmius (6). In MRR 2.445, and Index, 590, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.363-364, no. 349, 87 B.C. See also L. R. Taylor, VDRR 233.
Cos. 76. For evidence that he was praetor urbanus in 79 and author of the Formula Octaviana, see B. W. Frier, TAPhA 113, 1983, 221-241, esp. 222, note 3, and 232-233.
Cos. 191. An elogium, found at Luna, reads as follows: M: Acilius C. f. | Scarpea cepi (R. U. Inglieri, NSA 1952, fasc. 7-12, 20-ILLRP 321a). See MRR 1.352.[1]
Tr. Pl. 44. See MRR 2.324, 559. Delete the filiation, which is unattested, and note that he served under Mark Antony in Macedonia as well as Syria. See Syme, RP 1.31-41.
Legatus with Lucullus 69-68. See MRR 2.134. Perhaps better to assume a corruption in the text of Dio 36.3.2-3, and read Sextilius. See Wiseman, NM 259, no. 384.
Tr. pl. 449. The manuscript tradition of Livy 3.54.13 favors the praenomen Ap. rather than the P. adopted by Sigonius and the Conway-Walters text. See Ogilvie, Comm. Liv. 496-497.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.431, and Index, 531, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.470, no. 455, 47 B.C. See Appian BC 4.40, and Syme, JRS 53, 1963, 59, note 42?RP 2.563, note 4.

Cos. 50. Besides Mènzer (see MRR 2.208), Shackleton Bailey would identify the candidate for the aedileship of 56 with the future consul of 50 (CLA 2.178).
Praefectus fabrum (#) honored by Hieropolis Castabala (E. L. Hicks, JHS 10, 1890, 245-AEpig. 1891, no. 27). Perhaps in the first century B.C.
Officer at Octavian's naval base at Lipara 37-36** see MRR 2.406. Grant (FITA 52-54) suggests that he was P. Alfenus Varus, Cos. A.D. 2, but Cadoux favors his father, Cos. suff. 39. (TJC)
Tr. pl. 42. See MRR 2.359. In MRR 2.421, he is better listed as a leg., lieut. or a praef. class., as in the Index, 2.574, than as a promagistrate. See Wiseman, NM 236, no. 216.
Cos. 97. Leg., lieut. 87. See MRR 2.50, 52, note 7. The sources are contradictory regarding the circumstances and the order of the deaths of father and son.
Monetalis. In MRR 2.437, and Index,. 551, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.302-303, no. 288, 115 or 114 B.C. Identification with RE no. 97 is quite uncertain.
Senator in 44. See MRR 2.491, and above, on M. Asellius? M. f. Maec. The notice in Plu't. Cic. 27.2 indicates that there was a senator of low birth named M. Gellius.
Quaestor. In MRR 2.77, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.385 (cf 381-386), no. 366, 4, probably a quaestorian coinage with L. Fabius Hispaniensis under C. Annius in Spain.
An officer under the Triumvirs who issued coins at the naval base at Lipara in 37-36 (MRR 2.406). The nomen may be Calpenus or Calpetanus or Calpurnius. See Wiseman, NM 280, no. 527.
Quaestor 58. In MRR 2.434, and Index, 542, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.419, no. 408, 67 B.C., with the inscription C. Plso L. f. Frugi. Cicero's son-in-law.
Cos. 120. Contrary to the filiation given by Degrassi (Inscr. Ital. 13.1.472** cf. MRR 1.523), his filiation should be either M?. f. P. n. or P. f. P. n. (Sumner, Orators 62).
Monetalis. In MRR 2.449, and Index, 606, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.351- 352, no. 343, 89 B.C. See Wiseman, NC 1964, 156** R. Rowland, Historia 18, 1969, 374.
Tr. pl. 44. On P. Servilius Casca Longus (53)admiral under Brutus in 42, see MRR 2.340 (cf. Cic. Phil. 2.27), 366, and refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.517-518, no. 507, 42 B.C.[194x]
Cos. 499. The praenomen is more probably P., since it is clearly attributed to the quaestor of 509 (MRR 1.3). See also Ogilvie, Comm. Liv. 284.
Prefect Alexandria 47. The freedman's son to whom Caesar gave command of the three legions he left at Alexandria in 47 (Suet. Iul. 76.3). (RS, CP)
Aedile or Iudex quaestionis 86. See MRR 2.54, 57, note 3. The entries ought to be Aedile, 86, Iudex quaestionis, 85 (Sumner, Orators 111). Cf. Syme, CPh 50, 1955, 133.[17]
Aed. pl., uncertain date. See MRR 2.467. It is possible that he was a municipal, not a Roman, aedile (ILLRP 463** cf. Badian, Dial. Di Archeol. 4-5, no. 2-3, 1972, 379).
Senator in 129. Delete this entry in MRR 2.498 and in the Index, 635. It is based on a misreading of the SC de agro Pergameno. See Sherk, RDGE no. 12, pp. 63-73.
Other names, Plautius, for example, are possible. See Badian, Historia 12, 1963, 131.[2x]

Leg., propr. mid-first century. From Verona (NS 1892, 10), probably funerary** one of the earliest Transpadane senators (Wiseman, CQ 15, 1968, 158-159** NM 255, no. 348)
Senator in 43. See MRR 2.496. On the possibility that his name was Selicius, see Syme, Historia 13, 1964, 122123-RP 2.601, citing Cic. Att. 13.4, and CIL 12.294-299.
He served as a tribune of the soldiers under Marcellus against Hannibal at Canusium (Liv. 27.12.16). See Suolahti, Junior Officers 308, 405. See below, on M. Licinius (20).
Tr. pl. 47. In MRR 2.287, add the cognomen (Fides)** see Cic. Phil. 6.11, and Shackleton Bailey** CLF 2.531, on Fam. 11.13. Cf. also Sumner, Phoenix 25, 1971, 262.
Pr. 166. Leg., amb. b, with C. Petronius (86, cf. 89), listed in 156 in MRR 1.448. See Chr. Habicht, Hermes 84, 1956, 101ff., who dates the embassy in 155.
? Monetalis. In MRR 2.452, and Index, 617, refer also to Crawford, RRC 1.487-495, no. 480, 44 B.C. (with L. Aemilius Buca, M. Mettius, and C. Cossutius Maridianus)

Pr. procos., 113-114. See MRR 1.538, 539, note 4. Sumner places him in Hisp. Ult. as praetor in 113 and as procos. until his death in battle in 111 (Orators 72).
